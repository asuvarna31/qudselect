What was uncovered?	The Andy Warhol Museum, CMU and the Carnegie Museum of Art - which all had a hand in the project - revealed the story Thursday morning in three news releases that included some of the images.	3

Those three images of an altered Botticelli's 'Venus,' a Warhol self-portrait, and a Campbell's soup can - of 28 that were found on the disks - were enough to excite Warhol fanatics around the world over the possibility that something - anything - new by the King of Pop Art had been revealed.	3
What were the original Digital Images used for?	They were created on Warhol's Commodore Amiga computer in 1985 and included versions of some of his other most iconic images such as a banana and Marilyn Monroe, neither of which have been released yet, and may never be.	3
What do experts say about the history of the pictures?	While the historic value will take more research and debate to be figured out, Matt Wrbican, the Andy Warhol Museum's chief archivist, said the interest is understandable for one of the world's most prolific and studied artists.	3
What did people find out about the images?	And, like the discovery of a missing, old world masterpiece, within hours of the Warhol discovery hitting the Internet and going around the world, Wrbican heard from someone who does not believe that Warhol himself created the images the computer sleuths found.	1
