And it's laughably elementary: What is horticulture, anyway?	What is horticulture?	1
By the book, horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, and ornamental plants.	What do people think of horticulture according to the book?	1
More often, in the public mind, 'it's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower, a low-paying job requiring manual labor and no college degree,' said Mary H. Meyer, horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota and, as president of the American Society for Horticultural Science, a critical force in the campaign.	What other career options does Mary H. Meyer believe horticulture can provide?	1
Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble.	How common is this problem globally?	1
This crisis is not unique to the United States, as Meyer discovered during a teaching stint in England over the summer: England, the world's horticultural powerhouse, faces the same problems.	What is England's problem?	1
Horticulturists in both countries say the crisis has been building for decades, greatly influenced by the globalization of the food and flower trades, the population shift from farm to city, and the loss of personal connection to the land.	What is the direct impact of the trades leaving many people with little personal connection to the land?	1
The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a pollen-borne RNA virus that spread systematically through the bees and hives.	How did the researchers conclude that the honeybees became infected by the pollen-borne RNA virus?	1
Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio.	What does the virus do?	1
The tobacco ringspot virus acts as a 'quasi-species,' replicating in a way that creates ample mutations that subvert the host's immune response.	How do the resulting mutations affect the virus?	1
'They have a high mutation rate,' said Yan Ping Chen, a bee pathologist at the USDA Agricultural Research Service laboratory in Maryland and lead author of the study.	Why do they have a high mutation rate?	1
But those colonies have been collapsing, and scientists have attributed that devastation to a deadly cocktail of pathogens, as well as pesticides and beekeeping practices that stress the insect's immune system.	How does the virus impact the bees?	1
But we do have evidence that TRSV along with other viruses that we screen on a regular basis are associated with lower rates of over-winter survival'.	What evidence is there that the virus is associated with lower rates of over-winter survival?	1

LOS ANGELES - The booming illegal international wildlife trade forced conservationists to do the unthinkable Tuesday: Brand the golden domes of two of the rarest tortoises on Earth to reduce their black market value by making it easier for authorities to trace them if stolen.	What did the conservationists do to help their endangered species?	1
With a steady hand and an electric engraving tool, he carved an identification code on the high, rounded shell as the creature with weary eyes and gleaming carapace peered calmly into the distance.	What happened to the tortoise after that?	1
The tortoise was branded for life, which in her case would be roughly 160 years.	Why did they choose to tag the tortoise for life?	1
Now, sanctuaries and zoos are using visible identification marks - shell notches, clipped toenails, paint, laser inscribing, tattoos and engraving - as a tool to fight poaching and dissuade wealthy collectors willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for critically endangered turtles and tortoises.	What other ways are the conservancies using shell identification marks to fight poaching?	1
