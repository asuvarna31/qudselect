But the technological sleuthing it took a group of Carnegie Mellon University students and alumni to recover and preserve some digital images apparently created and stored by Andy Warhol on old-school floppy computer disks nearly 30 years ago is a tale worth telling. The Andy Warhol Museum, CMU and the Carnegie Museum of Art - which all had a hand in the project - revealed the story Thursday morning in three news releases that included some of the images. Those three images of an altered Botticelli's 'Venus,' a Warhol self-portrait, and a Campbell's soup can - of 28 that were found on the disks - were enough to excite Warhol fanatics around the world over the possibility that something - anything - new by the King of Pop Art had been revealed. They were created on Warhol's Commodore Amiga computer in 1985 and included versions of some of his other most iconic images such as a banana and Marilyn Monroe, neither of which have been released yet, and may never be. While the historic value will take more research and debate to be figured out, Matt Wrbican, the Andy Warhol Museum's chief archivist, said the interest is understandable for one of the world's most prolific and studied artists. 'It's something that's new,' he said, 'and that doesn't happen very often with Warhol'. And, like the discovery of a missing, old world masterpiece, within hours of the Warhol discovery hitting the Internet and going around the world, Wrbican heard from someone who does not believe that Warhol himself created the images the computer sleuths found. A man who worked with the now-defunct Amiga World magazine - which did a story in January 1986 about Warhol and his use of the Amiga computer - called after reading a story about the discovery Thursday and said he 'doesn't think Warhol actually made a lot of those images,' Wrbican said. Wrbican said he will talk more with the person who called - he could not recall his name - and 'we'll discuss it with him'. But if the images were not solely created by Warhol - who died in 1987 - on the computer, it would not necessarily affect their historic value in helping to further understand him. 'Like a lot of his work, it was a collaboration,' he said.","What was Warhol trying to accomplish with these images?",1

It was just Warhol learning a new tool'. The museum knew it had Warhol's Amiga computer and floppy disks for some time, Wrbican said, and accessing it 'was something I'd wanted to do for awhile, but there are only so many hours in a day'. It took a modern day, multimedia artist - and self professed Warhol fanatic - to finally get the ball rolling.","What idea did Kukielski have for the exhibit?",3

The Charleston Fire Department was continuing to give away cases of bottled water for free, and late Monday afternoon, a steady stream of vehicles crept through a station about a mile north of downtown. Fire Capt. Eddie Moore estimated that firefighters, police officers and other volunteers at the station had given away 2,500 cases of water Monday - more than 80,000 16-ounce bottles, or two tractor-trailers full. Firefighters loaded several cases into every vehicle that drove through. Inside the station, the firefighters were surviving on frozen dinners, and Moore said the licorice smell from the taps was especially strong Monday morning. Bernard Casdorph, 64, a field deputy for the county assessor's office, said he was making twice-daily trips to the station to collect water for himself, his mother, her neighbor and a cousin who uses a wheelchair.

When the stairs collapsed, they were trapped in a recreation room that had thick plastic glass windows, said firefighter union president Joseph King. Their oxygen supplies ran out as they tried in vain to break through the windows with helmets and fire axes, King said, adding, 'They had nowhere to go.' To make matters worse, the fire burned through a hose they had dragged with them, said fire Chief Charles Dickinson. Another team was able to enter through a rear door and rescue the three injured firefighters. Family members reported the fire at shortly before 12:30 a.m., saying they saw smoke coming out of a heating vent, authorities said. The fire was controlled around 2:45 a.m. The cause of the fire was under investigation Those killed were identified as Capt. Thomas Brooks, 42, and firefighters Patricia Conroy, 43, and Mark Kolenda, 27, according to the Allegheny County coroner's office. Conroy had been on the force for eight years and was one of its first women.","What was the smell like?",3

'I'll get the opportunity to play again, which I wouldn't have gotten here with Dom playing as well as he is,' said Fuhr, who played three games with the Sabres this season, posting a 4.0 goals-against average and a 1-2 record. His win came in the Sabres' season opener in New York against the Stanley Cup champion Rangers. With the Kings, Fuhr will be reunited with former Edmonton teammate Wayne Gretzky. Fuhr helped lead Edmonton to five Stanley Cups. Fuhr helped carry the Sabres past the first round in the playoffs two years ago, but injuries and Hasek's emergence as the dominant goalie kept him on the bench much of last season and this year. Fuhr, 32, earning dlrs 1.6 million this year, was a likely candidate for a trade after the Sabres signed the 29-year-old Hasek to a three-year, dlrs 8 million contract. Hasek said he was sorry to see Fuhr go, but said his departure would not affect his own game.","How does Hasek feel about being traded?",3

It's a first for The Dali, which is an entire museum devoted to the surrealist master's work. Museum executive director Hank Hine said during a media tour Wednesday that the exhibit - called 'Warhol: Art. Mortality'. - is the first large-scale special exhibit for the museum since it moved into a stunning new building along St. Petersburg's waterfront in 2011. 'This is totally appropriate to the legacy of Dali,' said Hine. The exhibit showcases some of Warhol's famous silkscreens, including a red self-portrait taken a year before he died.

They were created on Warhol's Commodore Amiga computer in 1985 and included versions of some of his other most iconic images such as a banana and Marilyn Monroe, neither of which have been released yet, and may never be. While the historic value will take more research and debate to be figured out, Matt Wrbican, the Andy Warhol Museum's chief archivist, said the interest is understandable for one of the world's most prolific and studied artists. 'It's something that's new,' he said, 'and that doesn't happen very often with Warhol'. And, like the discovery of a missing, old world masterpiece, within hours of the Warhol discovery hitting the Internet and going around the world, Wrbican heard from someone who does not believe that Warhol himself created the images the computer sleuths found.","What is Wrbican's plan regarding the person who called and expressed doubt about Warhol's authorship of the images found on the floppy disks?",1

It could still be days before everyone in the Charleston metropolitan area is cleared to use water, though officials say the water in certain designated areas was safe to drink and wash with as long as people flushed out their systems. They cautioned that the water may still have a slight licorice-type odor, raising the anxieties of some who believed it was still contaminated. 'I wouldn't drink it for a while. I'm skeptical about it,' said Wanda Blake, a cashier in the electronics section of a Charleston Kmart who fears she was exposed to the tainted water before she got word of the spill. 'I know I've ingested it'. By Tuesday morning, officials had given the green light to about 35 percent of West Virginia American Water's customers. Thursday's spill affected 100,000 customers in a nine-county area, or about 300,000 people in all. The water crisis shuttered schools, restaurants and day-care centers, and truckloads of water had to be brought in from out of state. People were told to use the water only to flush their toilets. Hospitals were flushing out systems as were schools, which hoped to open again Wednesday.

Dali was a generation older - born in 1904 - than Warhol, who was born in 1928, but both captivated the public with their attention-getting and sometimes controversial works of art. Warhol often visited Dali when Dali stayed in a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York (one story goes that Dali tied Warhol to a spinning board and splattered paint over him).","What happened when Warhol made a screen test of Dali?",1
"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Andy Warhol was an early adopter of selfies, if a new exhibit showcasing his work is any indication. The iconic pop artist's work is showcased in a large new exhibit at The Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., and it includes paintings, drawings and yes, self-portraits - taken with the Instagram of the 1970s, Polaroid. There's Warhol posing with a skull, Warhol looking moody in black and white and Warhol wedged in between John Lennon and Yoko Ono (bonus points: celebrity selfie!). And despite the 1970s clothing and Studio 54-era glitter of the art and photographs, the exhibit feels fresh. Warhol's vision of pop culture and fame fits right in with America's 21st century love of the Kardashians and TMZ.com. The exhibit of more than 100 works and some films opens to the public Saturday and runs through April 27. The works are on loan from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, where Warhol was born and raised before moving to New York City. It's a first for The Dali, which is an entire museum devoted to the surrealist master's work. Museum executive director Hank Hine said during a media tour Wednesday that the exhibit - called 'Warhol: Art. Mortality'. - is the first large-scale special exhibit for the museum since it moved into a stunning new building along St. Petersburg's waterfront in 2011. 'This is totally appropriate to the legacy of Dali,' said Hine.","What other interactive feature does the Warhol exhibit offer besides showcasing his screen tests?",2

'Like a lot of his work, it was a collaboration,' he said.

Hospitals were flushing out systems as were schools, which hoped to open again Wednesday. In downtown Charleston, the first section of the city where water was declared safe, few signs of the crisis were visible late Monday and hotel guests were informed they could use everything but the ice machines. But many businesses remained shuttered in outlying residential neighborhoods. Charleston attorney Anthony Majestro represents several businesses that lost money while shut down and said he has lost count of the numerous lawsuits filed over the spill. The Charleston Fire Department was continuing to give away cases of bottled water for free, and late Monday afternoon, a steady stream of vehicles crept through a station about a mile north of downtown. Fire Capt. Eddie Moore estimated that firefighters, police officers and other volunteers at the station had given away 2,500 cases of water Monday - more than 80,000 16-ounce bottles, or two tractor-trailers full. Firefighters loaded several cases into every vehicle that drove through.","What did Bernard Casdorph do?",2

Continuing controversy over her inflammatory statements, along with allegations of financial irregularities, could bring a showdown between the couple that separated in 1992.

There was no immediate comment from the government in Sarajevo on the ultimatum, which is bound to result in an upsurge of fighting if carried out. Except for the Bihac pocket, the truce has kept most of Bosnia quiet since coming into effect Jan. 1. But U.N. officials said that President Alija Izetbegovic warned Akashi in a letter sent Monday that unless fighting around Bihac ceased immediately he would order other units to that front line to help government forces.","What is the purpose of the U.N. aid convoy?",1

'I'll get the opportunity to play again, which I wouldn't have gotten here with Dom playing as well as he is,' said Fuhr, who played three games with the Sabres this season, posting a 4.0 goals-against average and a 1-2 record. His win came in the Sabres' season opener in New York against the Stanley Cup champion Rangers. With the Kings, Fuhr will be reunited with former Edmonton teammate Wayne Gretzky. Fuhr helped lead Edmonton to five Stanley Cups. Fuhr helped carry the Sabres past the first round in the playoffs two years ago, but injuries and Hasek's emergence as the dominant goalie kept him on the bench much of last season and this year. Fuhr, 32, earning dlrs 1.6 million this year, was a likely candidate for a trade after the Sabres signed the 29-year-old Hasek to a three-year, dlrs 8 million contract. Hasek said he was sorry to see Fuhr go, but said his departure would not affect his own game.","What will Grant Fuhr miss?",1

Ljubijankic said conditions in the northwestern Bihac pocket had to improve within the next 24 hours or the Bosnian government would consider the truce invalid. In a letter to Akashi and to U.N. commanders, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic made a similar threat but cited no deadline. Fighting died down on two of three fronts in the northwest Bihac region. U.N. spokesman Col. Gary Coward said it was quiet around the town of Bihac. But 200 explosions were recorded Tuesday south and southeast of Velika Kladusa, Coward said. The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA quoted Bosnian Serb army commander Gen. Ratko Mladic as protesting in a letter to U.N. commander Lt. Gen. Rupert Smith a government offensive in which five villages south and southwest of Bihac were captured. Mladic claimed government forces were 'brutally destroying Serb settlements, plundering and burning houses and expelling civilians.' Croatia's news agency HINA also quoted a Bosnian Croat commander as saying his troops and the government army had jointly retaken six villages. Paul Risley, a U.N. spokesman in Zagreb, quoted Izetbegovic's letter as saying that unless Serb attacks on Bihac cease immediately, 'we will have no other choice but to activate other fronts' to draw Serb soldiers away and relieve pressure on Bihac. Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the existing four-month truce would be the last the Serbs accepted before 'final victory' if the international community does not negotiate a solution. SRNA quoted Karadzic as telling members of his Serbian Democratic Party in Banja Luka that in case of a new government offensive, the Serb army will respond with counter-offensives against all 'vital parts of their territory.' Except for the Bihac pocket, the ceassation of hostilities agreement signed by the government and Bosnian Serbs has kept most of Bosnia quiet since coming into effect Jan. 1. Serbs from Croatia and anti-government Muslims, both allied with Bosnia's rebel Serbs, are fighting the Bosnian government in the region and have repeatedly blocked aid shipments from the north and west. After they denied passage of a relief convoy for Bihac on Tuesday, Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the U.N.

"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Andy Warhol was an early adopter of selfies, if a new exhibit showcasing his work is any indication. The iconic pop artist's work is showcased in a large new exhibit at The Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., and it includes paintings, drawings and yes, self-portraits - taken with the Instagram of the 1970s, Polaroid. There's Warhol posing with a skull, Warhol looking moody in black and white and Warhol wedged in between John Lennon and Yoko Ono (bonus points: celebrity selfie!). And despite the 1970s clothing and Studio 54-era glitter of the art and photographs, the exhibit feels fresh. Warhol's vision of pop culture and fame fits right in with America's 21st century love of the Kardashians and TMZ.com. The exhibit of more than 100 works and some films opens to the public Saturday and runs through April 27. The works are on loan from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, where Warhol was born and raised before moving to New York City. It's a first for The Dali, which is an entire museum devoted to the surrealist master's work. Museum executive director Hank Hine said during a media tour Wednesday that the exhibit - called 'Warhol: Art. Mortality'. - is the first large-scale special exhibit for the museum since it moved into a stunning new building along St. Petersburg's waterfront in 2011. 'This is totally appropriate to the legacy of Dali,' said Hine.","What were some similarities between Salvador Dali and Andy Warhol?",3

It could still be days before everyone in the Charleston metropolitan area is cleared to use water, though officials say the water in certain designated areas was safe to drink and wash with as long as people flushed out their systems. They cautioned that the water may still have a slight licorice-type odor, raising the anxieties of some who believed it was still contaminated. 'I wouldn't drink it for a while. I'm skeptical about it,' said Wanda Blake, a cashier in the electronics section of a Charleston Kmart who fears she was exposed to the tainted water before she got word of the spill. 'I know I've ingested it'. By Tuesday morning, officials had given the green light to about 35 percent of West Virginia American Water's customers. Thursday's spill affected 100,000 customers in a nine-county area, or about 300,000 people in all. The water crisis shuttered schools, restaurants and day-care centers, and truckloads of water had to be brought in from out of state. People were told to use the water only to flush their toilets. Hospitals were flushing out systems as were schools, which hoped to open again Wednesday. In downtown Charleston, the first section of the city where water was declared safe, few signs of the crisis were visible late Monday and hotel guests were informed they could use everything but the ice machines.

Although the 15-year-old Illinois student was not diagnosed through a school program, in his school-based group therapy he's learning practical tips to identify his triggers and calm them before emotions spin out of control. 'I think it is a good idea because a lot of people think they don't need help but they actually do,' said the teen, who is not being identified by The Associated Press because he is a minor. The federal government does not keep track of school mental health screening, so it's all but impossible to say how many schools do or don't offer it. The offerings vary from intensive services to virtually none at all. 'No state is providing high-end services in all of their schools,' said Sharon Stephan, co-director of the Center for School Mental Health, a national organization based at the University of Maryland that provides training for schools and mental health providers.","What are some other examples of different screenings?",1

A man who worked with the now-defunct Amiga World magazine - which did a story in January 1986 about Warhol and his use of the Amiga computer - called after reading a story about the discovery Thursday and said he 'doesn't think Warhol actually made a lot of those images,' Wrbican said. Wrbican said he will talk more with the person who called - he could not recall his name - and 'we'll discuss it with him'. But if the images were not solely created by Warhol - who died in 1987 - on the computer, it would not necessarily affect their historic value in helping to further understand him. 'Like a lot of his work, it was a collaboration,' he said. Still, he said, even if Warhol had created the images all by himself, he noted: 'I want to emphasize we're not calling these art work.

The museum knew it had Warhol's Amiga computer and floppy disks for some time, Wrbican said, and accessing it 'was something I'd wanted to do for awhile, but there are only so many hours in a day'.

"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Andy Warhol was an early adopter of selfies, if a new exhibit showcasing his work is any indication. The iconic pop artist's work is showcased in a large new exhibit at The Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., and it includes paintings, drawings and yes, self-portraits - taken with the Instagram of the 1970s, Polaroid. There's Warhol posing with a skull, Warhol looking moody in black and white and Warhol wedged in between John Lennon and Yoko Ono (bonus points: celebrity selfie!). And despite the 1970s clothing and Studio 54-era glitter of the art and photographs, the exhibit feels fresh. Warhol's vision of pop culture and fame fits right in with America's 21st century love of the Kardashians and TMZ.com. The exhibit of more than 100 works and some films opens to the public Saturday and runs through April 27. The works are on loan from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, where Warhol was born and raised before moving to New York City. It's a first for The Dali, which is an entire museum devoted to the surrealist master's work.

'This is totally appropriate to the legacy of Dali,' said Hine. The exhibit showcases some of Warhol's famous silkscreens, including a red self-portrait taken a year before he died. There's also several panels of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and a few quirky versions of his Campbell's Soup cans. There are also TV monitors set up to show the artist's 'screen tests,' short films of a single person against a plain background.","What similarities did Salvador Dali and Andy Warhol share in their approach to art?",2
