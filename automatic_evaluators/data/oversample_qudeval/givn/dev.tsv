Pakistan won the match by one wicket. The approaches to the Australians were said to have been made by a prominent person in Pakistani cricket, who was not identified in the report.

With the owners out of the cats' line of vision, researchers played recordings of three strangers calling the cats' names followed by a call from the cat's owner and then by the call of another stranger. Researchers charted the cats' reactions by measuring a number of responses, including head movements, tail and ear movements, eye dilation and vocalization or whether they moved their paws. When strangers called their names, the cats had no reaction to the voices whatsoever. When the cats heard their names being called by their owners, they moved their heads and ears to locate where the sound was coming from.	What does this mean for cats?	1

When strangers called their names, the cats had no reaction to the voices whatsoever. When the cats heard their names being called by their owners, they moved their heads and ears to locate where the sound was coming from. Researchers say it proves that while cats can distinguish their owners' voices, their responses are not communicative. In other words, he hears you just fine, he just doesn't care what you want from him. I guess cat owners will just have to accept and appreciate that they get even that much of a response from a species that obviously believes we are on the planet to do its bidding. The study suggests that the reason cats are so standoffish might be traced back to their early domestication 10,000 years ago. Dogs are bred and have evolved 'to follow their owner's orders, but cats have not been,' co-author of the study, Saito, told Discovery News. They were not domesticated to work with people as dogs were and consequently feel themselves our equals. Cats originated in the Middle East from wild cats that killed rodents and kept them out of farmers' grain stores.	How do other animals normally respond to humans?	1

	What did Apple tell Nussbaum?	2
WASHINGTON - Jackie Nussbaum knew her son liked playing DragonVale on the family iPad - a colorful game with soothing music and chirping birds where kids raise adorable baby dragons. What she didn't realize was that he was buying virtual gems - with real money - to build his dragon park as part of the game. When she opened her credit card statement, she saw a slew of charges from Apple, totaling $600 in one day.	How did people react to the news of the charges?	1

When she opened her credit card statement, she saw a slew of charges from Apple, totaling $600 in one day. 'I thought it was a mistake, that someone had stolen my credit card,' said Nussbaum, a mother of two children in Westerville, Ohio. Apple told her the charges were valid purchases from the game DragonVale. 'I almost choked,' she said in an interview. 'It was shocking'. Tens of thousands of people who received similar shocks complained to the Federal Trade Commission, and the agency on Wednesday announced that Apple had agreed to refund at least $32.5 million to unsuspecting parents. 'You cannot charge consumers for purchases they did not authorize,' said Edith Ramirez, the commission chairwoman.	What else did the FTC find wrong?	1

'You cannot charge consumers for purchases they did not authorize,' said Edith Ramirez, the commission chairwoman. Too often, the FTC said, parents were caught unaware that in-app purchases were being made and Apple didn't do enough to make it clear children were buying gems, coins, or treats for their virtual pets. Parents also were not told that entering their password for a single-app purchase started a 15-minute clock during which kids could make unlimited purchases without any further action by an adult, the agency said. As part of the settlement, Apple also must change its billing practices to make it more obvious that a purchase is taking place during the course of the game or app. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Cupertino, Calif.-based company relented to the FTC because the consent decree 'does not require us to do anything we weren't already going to do, so we decided to accept it rather than take on a long and distracting legal fight'. Apple has taken a series of steps in recent years to ensure its app store is a 'safe place for customers of all ages,' he said in a memo sent to company employees Wednesday.

The fundamentalist groups, which oppose the Israel-PLO peace process, have claimed bombing attacks that killed 56 Israelis since October. During peace talks in Washington on Sunday, Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath pledged the PLO in writing to 'pre-empting terror, punishing those responsible and denying those who plan and carry out terror or violence any safe haven.' Rabin stressed he expected Arafat to disarm and prosecute the militants. 'We have made clear that the main obstacle in implementing what was and will be achieved in the negotiations is the terrorism,' Rabin said. 'Unless the Palestinian Authority takes significant steps, there will be great difficulty in advancing at a quicker pace' towards expanding Palestinian autonomy, he said.

But in the short term, it prevents tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching jobs in Israel, worsening an already desperate economic situation in the Palestinian areas. Rabin said he would discuss the closure with Arafat at a planned meeting Thursday. 'The closure is one of the means to increase security,' Rabin said. 'We will use it whenever we need it and relax it whenever we realize that measures are taken' by the Palestinians to reduce the chances of another attack.

President Clinton has approved a plan to offer Serbia a temporary lifting of economic sanctions if it recognizes Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. The aim is to make permanent a four-month cease-fire in Bosnia and to prevent the 34-month war there from spilling over into Croatia, the official said. The plan has the approval of Britain, France, Russia and Germany, the four other members of the so-called Contact Group that has sought a peace formula in vain. It will be presented to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the next few days, the official said. Among the sanctions that would be lifted are restrictions on fuel shipments to Belgrade and trade with the former Yugoslavia, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. As part of the deal, Milosevic would have to agree to the posting of more monitors on Serbia's border with Bosnia to check on compliance with a pledge to stop arming Serbs in Bosnia. The official stressed the sanctions would be lifted only temporarily and would be reimposed if the Serbian leader reneged. The plan would not affect Serbia's exclusion from the World Bank and other international groups.	What will become of Charles Thomas?	1

Seattle oceanographer Gregory Johnson was a lead author of the chapter on marine measurements, and even he was having a hard time wrapping his head around the massive compilation. So when a bad cold kept him in the house one weekend, Johnson decided to distill the report to its essence via a centuries-old Japanese art form: haiku. The result is a virtual booklet that is riding a wave of celebrity on the Web and in the Twittersphere. 'I was surprised that as many people responded as positively as they did,' said Johnson. 'It's been tweeted a thousand times, or something'. Online commenters penned companion verses, several teachers plan to use the booklet in their classrooms and fans are clamoring to translate Johnson's work into Hindi, Italian, German, French and Luxembourgish.

The agony of unrequited love. It may be what keeps us devoted to the felines in our lives. A recent study confirms what cat owners have long known. Our cats understand us when we talk to them, they just don't give a fig about what we have to say. A study by two University of Tokyo researchers, published by Springer in Animal Cognition journal, determined cats recognize their owners' voices from those of strangers. Conducted by Atsuko Saito and Kazutaka Shinozuka, the test included 20 domesticated cats from 14 homes that were tested in their own familiar places so the stress of moving them to strange surroundings had no role in the outcome of the tests. With the owners out of the cats' line of vision, researchers played recordings of three strangers calling the cats' names followed by a call from the cat's owner and then by the call of another stranger. Researchers charted the cats' reactions by measuring a number of responses, including head movements, tail and ear movements, eye dilation and vocalization or whether they moved their paws. When strangers called their names, the cats had no reaction to the voices whatsoever. When the cats heard their names being called by their owners, they moved their heads and ears to locate where the sound was coming from.

In other words, he hears you just fine, he just doesn't care what you want from him.

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday that Yasser Arafat must carry out a pledge to reign in anti-Israel violence and called on the Palestinian leader to outlaw two groups responsible for a wave of bombing attacks. Addressing Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Rabin revealed Israel has in recent months arrested 2,400 Palestinians on suspicion of militant activities, bringing the total of Palestinians held by Israel to nearly 6,000. He called on Arafat to ban the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups in autonomous Gaza Strip and Jericho. The fundamentalist groups, which oppose the Israel-PLO peace process, have claimed bombing attacks that killed 56 Israelis since October. During peace talks in Washington on Sunday, Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath pledged the PLO in writing to 'pre-empting terror, punishing those responsible and denying those who plan and carry out terror or violence any safe haven.' Rabin stressed he expected Arafat to disarm and prosecute the militants. 'We have made clear that the main obstacle in implementing what was and will be achieved in the negotiations is the terrorism,' Rabin said. 'Unless the Palestinian Authority takes significant steps, there will be great difficulty in advancing at a quicker pace' towards expanding Palestinian autonomy, he said. The violence has stalled efforts to expand the nine-month-old Gaza-Jericho autonomy throughout the West Bank.	What is the significance of Israel sealing off the West Bank and Gaza Strip?	1

That measure satisfies a growing desire among Israelis for a physical separation from the Palestinians and is seen by some as a prelude to eventual Palestinian independence from Israel. But in the short term, it prevents tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching jobs in Israel, worsening an already desperate economic situation in the Palestinian areas. Rabin said he would discuss the closure with Arafat at a planned meeting Thursday. 'The closure is one of the means to increase security,' Rabin said. 'We will use it whenever we need it and relax it whenever we realize that measures are taken' by the Palestinians to reduce the chances of another attack.

In one recent case, Rabin said, PLO police arrested an Islamic militant planning to kill Arafat, but a judge released the man for fear of retribution by the fundamentalists. In a separate criminal case, another judge released the suspect when someone fired a gunshot between his legs, Rabin quoted Arafat as saying.

President Clinton has approved a plan to offer Serbia a temporary lifting of economic sanctions if it recognizes Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday.

President Clinton has approved a plan to offer Serbia a temporary lifting of economic sanctions if it recognizes Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. The aim is to make permanent a four-month cease-fire in Bosnia and to prevent the 34-month war there from spilling over into Croatia, the official said. The plan has the approval of Britain, France, Russia and Germany, the four other members of the so-called Contact Group that has sought a peace formula in vain. It will be presented to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the next few days, the official said. Among the sanctions that would be lifted are restrictions on fuel shipments to Belgrade and trade with the former Yugoslavia, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. As part of the deal, Milosevic would have to agree to the posting of more monitors on Serbia's border with Bosnia to check on compliance with a pledge to stop arming Serbs in Bosnia. The official stressed the sanctions would be lifted only temporarily and would be reimposed if the Serbian leader reneged. The plan would not affect Serbia's exclusion from the World Bank and other international groups.	What will happen to U.S. negotiator Charles Thomas?	1

The U.S. official in Washington said he was reluctant to divulge details of the proposal even before they were presented to Milosevic. But he said a 'leak' to The Washington Times newspaper of a memorandum that did not give a complete account prompted his disclosure. The newspaper published some elements of the plan Tuesday. Peace efforts have stalled over the Bosnian Serbs' refusal to consider a five-nation peace plan that would set up ethnic zones in Bosnia with them in control of 49 percent and a Muslim-Croat federation 51 percent. The Serbs, now holding almost 70 percent of the country, have rejected the plan as one that would leave them with fragments of the country that are not politically or economically viable.

'I thought it was a mistake, that someone had stolen my credit card,' said Nussbaum, a mother of two children in Westerville, Ohio. Apple told her the charges were valid purchases from the game DragonVale. 'I almost choked,' she said in an interview. 'It was shocking'. Tens of thousands of people who received similar shocks complained to the Federal Trade Commission, and the agency on Wednesday announced that Apple had agreed to refund at least $32.5 million to unsuspecting parents. 'You cannot charge consumers for purchases they did not authorize,' said Edith Ramirez, the commission chairwoman. Too often, the FTC said, parents were caught unaware that in-app purchases were being made and Apple didn't do enough to make it clear children were buying gems, coins, or treats for their virtual pets. Parents also were not told that entering their password for a single-app purchase started a 15-minute clock during which kids could make unlimited purchases without any further action by an adult, the agency said. As part of the settlement, Apple also must change its billing practices to make it more obvious that a purchase is taking place during the course of the game or app. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Cupertino, Calif.-based company relented to the FTC because the consent decree 'does not require us to do anything we weren't already going to do, so we decided to accept it rather than take on a long and distracting legal fight'. Apple has taken a series of steps in recent years to ensure its app store is a 'safe place for customers of all ages,' he said in a memo sent to company employees Wednesday.

	What two groups did Rabin call on Arafat to ban?	1
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday that Yasser Arafat must carry out a pledge to reign in anti-Israel violence and called on the Palestinian leader to outlaw two groups responsible for a wave of bombing attacks. Addressing Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Rabin revealed Israel has in recent months arrested 2,400 Palestinians on suspicion of militant activities, bringing the total of Palestinians held by Israel to nearly 6,000. He called on Arafat to ban the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups in autonomous Gaza Strip and Jericho.	What did Yasser Arafat promise to do in Washington?	2

The fundamentalist groups, which oppose the Israel-PLO peace process, have claimed bombing attacks that killed 56 Israelis since October. During peace talks in Washington on Sunday, Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath pledged the PLO in writing to 'pre-empting terror, punishing those responsible and denying those who plan and carry out terror or violence any safe haven.' Rabin stressed he expected Arafat to disarm and prosecute the militants. 'We have made clear that the main obstacle in implementing what was and will be achieved in the negotiations is the terrorism,' Rabin said. 'Unless the Palestinian Authority takes significant steps, there will be great difficulty in advancing at a quicker pace' towards expanding Palestinian autonomy, he said.

Online commenters penned companion verses, several teachers plan to use the booklet in their classrooms and fans are clamoring to translate Johnson's work into Hindi, Italian, German, French and Luxembourgish.

SEATTLE - There's little lyrical language to be found in the most recent international report on climate change. The document from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) runs to 2,200 pages and is crammed with technical details about greenhouse gas emissions, rising sea levels and atmospheric circulation. Seattle oceanographer Gregory Johnson was a lead author of the chapter on marine measurements, and even he was having a hard time wrapping his head around the massive compilation.

Halbish said all details available had been sent by courier to the ICC headquarters in London and should soon be in the hands of the game's governing body. The ICC has launched an investigation into allegations that leading Australian players were offered bribes to throw matches during their October-November tour of Pakistan. Media reports named spin bowlers Shane Warne and Tim May as being among those who were offered bribes, but the players -- in New Zealand for a limited-overs tournament -- have been instructed to make no comment. The Melbourne Age, meanwhile, Wednesday named Pakistan captain Salim Malik as the man who made the bribe offers -- a report Malik strenuously denied. The Age, a respected broadsheet, also reported Australian batsman Mark Waugh was allegedly offered U.S. dlrs 100,000 to throw away his wicket during the same tour.

'In response to that request, the ACB yesterday forwarded to the ICC, by courier, copies of statements made by members of the tour party. 'Neither the (ACB) chairman Alan Crompton, nor myself, has any further comment. The matter is now in the hands of the ICC.' According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, Warne and May were offered U.S. dlrs 50,000 to throw the first Test against Pakistan by bowling badly and allowing the Pakistan batsmen easy runs. Pakistan won the match by one wicket.	Was this prominent person Malik?	1

'I thought it was a mistake, that someone had stolen my credit card,' said Nussbaum, a mother of two children in Westerville, Ohio. Apple told her the charges were valid purchases from the game DragonVale. 'I almost choked,' she said in an interview. 'It was shocking'. Tens of thousands of people who received similar shocks complained to the Federal Trade Commission, and the agency on Wednesday announced that Apple had agreed to refund at least $32.5 million to unsuspecting parents. 'You cannot charge consumers for purchases they did not authorize,' said Edith Ramirez, the commission chairwoman. Too often, the FTC said, parents were caught unaware that in-app purchases were being made and Apple didn't do enough to make it clear children were buying gems, coins, or treats for their virtual pets. Parents also were not told that entering their password for a single-app purchase started a 15-minute clock during which kids could make unlimited purchases without any further action by an adult, the agency said. As part of the settlement, Apple also must change its billing practices to make it more obvious that a purchase is taking place during the course of the game or app. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Cupertino, Calif.-based company relented to the FTC because the consent decree 'does not require us to do anything we weren't already going to do, so we decided to accept it rather than take on a long and distracting legal fight'. Apple has taken a series of steps in recent years to ensure its app store is a 'safe place for customers of all ages,' he said in a memo sent to company employees Wednesday.

In Nussbaum's case, she called Apple right away and the company refunded her the $600 that her son, Andrew, had racked up. Nussbaum said Andrew, who was 10 at the time, had no idea he was buying gems with 'real money'. He felt so bad, she said, he was going to sell his old toys to pay her back. The refund spared him that. Nussbaum also said Apple walked her through setting up password protections for in-app purchases and she hasn't had a problem since.

Researchers charted the cats' reactions by measuring a number of responses, including head movements, tail and ear movements, eye dilation and vocalization or whether they moved their paws. When strangers called their names, the cats had no reaction to the voices whatsoever. When the cats heard their names being called by their owners, they moved their heads and ears to locate where the sound was coming from.

What she didn't realize was that he was buying virtual gems - with real money - to build his dragon park as part of the game. When she opened her credit card statement, she saw a slew of charges from Apple, totaling $600 in one day. 'I thought it was a mistake, that someone had stolen my credit card,' said Nussbaum, a mother of two children in Westerville, Ohio. Apple told her the charges were valid purchases from the game DragonVale. 'I almost choked,' she said in an interview.

WASHINGTON - Jackie Nussbaum knew her son liked playing DragonVale on the family iPad - a colorful game with soothing music and chirping birds where kids raise adorable baby dragons. What she didn't realize was that he was buying virtual gems - with real money - to build his dragon park as part of the game. When she opened her credit card statement, she saw a slew of charges from Apple, totaling $600 in one day. 'I thought it was a mistake, that someone had stolen my credit card,' said Nussbaum, a mother of two children in Westerville, Ohio. Apple told her the charges were valid purchases from the game DragonVale. 'I almost choked,' she said in an interview. 'It was shocking'. Tens of thousands of people who received similar shocks complained to the Federal Trade Commission, and the agency on Wednesday announced that Apple had agreed to refund at least $32.5 million to unsuspecting parents. 'You cannot charge consumers for purchases they did not authorize,' said Edith Ramirez, the commission chairwoman. Too often, the FTC said, parents were caught unaware that in-app purchases were being made and Apple didn't do enough to make it clear children were buying gems, coins, or treats for their virtual pets. Parents also were not told that entering their password for a single-app purchase started a 15-minute clock during which kids could make unlimited purchases without any further action by an adult, the agency said. As part of the settlement, Apple also must change its billing practices to make it more obvious that a purchase is taking place during the course of the game or app. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Cupertino, Calif.-based company relented to the FTC because the consent decree 'does not require us to do anything we weren't already going to do, so we decided to accept it rather than take on a long and distracting legal fight'. Apple has taken a series of steps in recent years to ensure its app store is a 'safe place for customers of all ages,' he said in a memo sent to company employees Wednesday. In Nussbaum's case, she called Apple right away and the company refunded her the $600 that her son, Andrew, had racked up. Nussbaum said Andrew, who was 10 at the time, had no idea he was buying gems with 'real money'. He felt so bad, she said, he was going to sell his old toys to pay her back. The refund spared him that. Nussbaum also said Apple walked her through setting up password protections for in-app purchases and she hasn't had a problem since.

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday that Yasser Arafat must carry out a pledge to reign in anti-Israel violence and called on the Palestinian leader to outlaw two groups responsible for a wave of bombing attacks.	What actions does Rabin expect Arafat to take against the militants?	1
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday that Yasser Arafat must carry out a pledge to reign in anti-Israel violence and called on the Palestinian leader to outlaw two groups responsible for a wave of bombing attacks. Addressing Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Rabin revealed Israel has in recent months arrested 2,400 Palestinians on suspicion of militant activities, bringing the total of Palestinians held by Israel to nearly 6,000. He called on Arafat to ban the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups in autonomous Gaza Strip and Jericho. The fundamentalist groups, which oppose the Israel-PLO peace process, have claimed bombing attacks that killed 56 Israelis since October. During peace talks in Washington on Sunday, Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath pledged the PLO in writing to 'pre-empting terror, punishing those responsible and denying those who plan and carry out terror or violence any safe haven.' Rabin stressed he expected Arafat to disarm and prosecute the militants. 'We have made clear that the main obstacle in implementing what was and will be achieved in the negotiations is the terrorism,' Rabin said. 'Unless the Palestinian Authority takes significant steps, there will be great difficulty in advancing at a quicker pace' towards expanding Palestinian autonomy, he said. The violence has stalled efforts to expand the nine-month-old Gaza-Jericho autonomy throughout the West Bank.	What is the potential implication of Israel's decision to seal off the West Bank and Gaza Strip?	1

The violence has stalled efforts to expand the nine-month-old Gaza-Jericho autonomy throughout the West Bank. The last attack, in which 21 Israeli were killed on Jan. 22, prompted Israel to seal off the West Bank and Gaza Strip. That measure satisfies a growing desire among Israelis for a physical separation from the Palestinians and is seen by some as a prelude to eventual Palestinian independence from Israel. But in the short term, it prevents tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching jobs in Israel, worsening an already desperate economic situation in the Palestinian areas. Rabin said he would discuss the closure with Arafat at a planned meeting Thursday. 'The closure is one of the means to increase security,' Rabin said. 'We will use it whenever we need it and relax it whenever we realize that measures are taken' by the Palestinians to reduce the chances of another attack.

In one recent case, Rabin said, PLO police arrested an Islamic militant planning to kill Arafat, but a judge released the man for fear of retribution by the fundamentalists. In a separate criminal case, another judge released the suspect when someone fired a gunshot between his legs, Rabin quoted Arafat as saying.

President Clinton has approved a plan to offer Serbia a temporary lifting of economic sanctions if it recognizes Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. The aim is to make permanent a four-month cease-fire in Bosnia and to prevent the 34-month war there from spilling over into Croatia, the official said. The plan has the approval of Britain, France, Russia and Germany, the four other members of the so-called Contact Group that has sought a peace formula in vain.

The result is a virtual booklet that is riding a wave of celebrity on the Web and in the Twittersphere. 'I was surprised that as many people responded as positively as they did,' said Johnson. 'It's been tweeted a thousand times, or something'. Online commenters penned companion verses, several teachers plan to use the booklet in their classrooms and fans are clamoring to translate Johnson's work into Hindi, Italian, German, French and Luxembourgish. Mother Jones blogger Chris Mooney praised Johnson for summing up climate change in an 'understandable, and even moving, way'. Johnson took as his template the IPCC's 'Summary for Policymakers,' crafting a haiku for each of 19 main points.	What does Johnson's haiku say about the impact of global warming on ice and snow?	1
