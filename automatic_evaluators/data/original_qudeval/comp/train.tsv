More often, in the public mind, 'it's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower, a low-paying job requiring manual labor and no college degree,' said Mary H. Meyer, horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota and, as president of the American Society for Horticultural Science, a critical force in the campaign.	1
What other career options does Mary H. Meyer believe horticulture can provide?	Meyer cites other career opportunities: plant breeding; greenhouse and food production; the cut-flower, landscape, and nursery industries; public gardens, parks, and sports turf; research into global climate change, plant pests, and diseases, water quality, biofuels, and food safety and security; and the psychological and physiological benefits of plants.	1

What is one possible explanation for the decline in sardine populations on the West Coast?	One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast.	1
What is the likelihood of sardines recovering from their decline?	If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve.	1
What is the overall concern regarding the sardine crash on the West Coast?	But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm.	1
What actions have been taken in response to the decline in sardine populations?	Spawning has taken a dive too. In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright.	1
What is the opinion of the conservation group Oceana regarding the harvesting of sardines during a population decline?	'We shouldn't be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,' said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery.	1
What is the typical behavior of sardine populations and how do they respond to changes in the ocean environment?	It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment.	1

What are some examples of current legal battles being fought by the LGBTQ+ community that could benefit from the court's ruling on juror protections based on sexual orientation?	A challenge to Nevada's marriage law is already pending in the 9th Circuit, and gays are fighting marriage bans in trial courts in Oregon, Idaho and Arizona.	1
What was the rationale behind the court's decision to extend juror protections to sexual orientation?	When a law discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it must be closely evaluated to 'ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status,' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court.	1

What is the virus' role in the collapse of honeybee colonies and how difficult is it to measure its impact?	The virus' relative role in the demise of colonies has not been measured - it would be difficult to separate it from a cocktail of pathogens and stresses negatively affecting bees, Chen said.	1
What evidence do we have regarding the role of the tobacco ringspot virus in the collapse of honeybee colonies?	But we do have evidence that TRSV along with other viruses that we screen on a regular basis are associated with lower rates of over-winter survival'.	1
What is the correlation between the new virus and the collapse of honeybee colonies?	Indeed, the new virus, along with the well documented Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, was correlated with colonies deemed 'weak' due to a variety of stresses.	1
What role did Varroa mites play in the spread of the tobacco ringspot virus within honeybee colonies?	Varroa mites, a 'vampire' parasite, also were found to carry the virus but were not infected, leading researchers to conclude that they aided the spread of the virus within the colony.	1

How could the sun help?	Using a special solar-powered tag, marine scientists now can study a shark's movements for up to two years by way of data beamed to satellites.	1
What was previously used?	Previously, researchers relied on tags that ran on batteries and sometimes died before all the information could be transmitted.	1
What is the purpose of studying their movements?	The goal is to better understand their migratory patterns and ultimately keep their population healthy.	1
Why are sharks hunted?	Sharks are critical to the overall balance of ocean ecosystems, but commercial fishermen catch them by the millions for their fins, cartilage and meat.	1
How well are shark migration patterns understood?	'We've learned a lot from tagging sharks, not least of which is that they are highly migratory,' said Antonio Fins, executive director of the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation, which supports the institute.	1
What does 'highly migratory' entail?	They don't know borders or nationalities'.	1
Have these new tags been tested yet?	About 40 research agencies already use solar tags, which were put on the market two years ago.	1
Have there been any failures with the tags?	But so far marine researchers have encountered no serious problems, and a growing number of agencies plan to purchase them, manufactures said.	1
