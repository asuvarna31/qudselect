U.S. exports of nuclear material cannot be adequately traced from country to country, according to a congressional report. 'Scarcely a day goes by without a report of a new black market deal,' said Sen. John Glenn in a statement reacting to the report. 'Given the staggering amount of nuclear materials we have exported, it could only be a matter of time before some of this deadly contraband proves to be of U.S. origin.' As chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs in the last Congress, Glenn commissioned the report from the General Accounting Office, which conducts investigations for legislators. The report says hundreds of tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium have accumulated worldwide, mostly from nuclear power generation.	What else does the report not include?	1

The report says hundreds of tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium have accumulated worldwide, mostly from nuclear power generation. It does not include figures on U.S. nuclear exports but says 71 export licenses for nuclear materials were granted in 1993. Nuclear exports for weapons use or weapons research are prohibited, as is transfer of nuclear materials to a third country. The report said U.S. tracking showed that Japan produced about 20.3 metric tons of plutonium from U.S. materials between 1978 and 1992, but Japanese records showed 58.7 tons.

Amid skepticism that Russia's war in Chechnya can be ended across a negotiating table, peace talks were set to resume Wednesday in neighboring Ingushetia. The scheduled resumption of talks in the town of Sleptsovsk came two days after agreement on a limited cease-fire, calling for both sides to stop using heavy artillery Tuesday. They also agreed in principle to work out a mechanism for exchanging prisoners of war and the dead. Despite the pact, artillery fire sounded in the Grozny on Tuesday, and there were reports of Chechen missile attacks southwest of the Chechen capital. Many Chechens are fighting independently of the forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, and Dudayev's representative at the peace talks, Aslan Maskhadov, has warned that he does not control them. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Tuesday that Moscow is also willing to talk to individual field commanders, the Interfax news agency reported. Similar offers in the past have been ignored by the feisty Chechens. The talks Wednesday were to be held in Sleptsovsk with the Russian side represented by Col. Gen. Anatoly Kulikov, commander of Russian troops in Chechnya.	Why do some feel the cease-fire can hold?	1

President Clinton has approved a proposal to ease trade and other economic sanctions against Serbia in a new effort to end the war in Bosnia, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. In return, President Slobodan Milosevic would have to recognize Bosnia as a sovereign country, a blow to his hopes for a Greater Serbia, and agree to other conditions designed to end the 34-month ethnic conflict. The aim is to drive a wedge between Milosevic and the Serbs in Bosnia who have rejected past peace proposals by isolating them from their patrons and arms suppliers in Belgrade.

President Clinton has approved a proposal to ease trade and other economic sanctions against Serbia in a new effort to end the war in Bosnia, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. In return, President Slobodan Milosevic would have to recognize Bosnia as a sovereign country, a blow to his hopes for a Greater Serbia, and agree to other conditions designed to end the 34-month ethnic conflict. The aim is to drive a wedge between Milosevic and the Serbs in Bosnia who have rejected past peace proposals by isolating them from their patrons and arms suppliers in Belgrade. The main lure for Milosevic would be at least temporary renewal of trade and fuel supplies. The sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security Council, have devastated Serbia's economy. Under the proposal cleared by Clinton and the governments of Britain, France, Germany and Russia, economic sanctions would be lifted -- or later reimposed -- depending on Milosevic's actions. Milosevic would be required to recognize three other former Yugoslav republics, Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia, thereby acknowledging the breakup of what once was Yugoslavia, and permit stricter policing of his border with Bosnia. At the United Nations, a spokesman said Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 'would welcome mutual recognition between the successor states of the former Yugoslavia and, in those circumstances, the lifting of the sanctions imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.' The spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said Boutros-Ghali favors 'any development which will make it possible for the Security Council to maintain' U.N. protection forces in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Weapons are still getting through to the Serbs in Bosnia despite a pledge by Milosevic to cut them off, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under the proposed deal, Milosevic would have to agree to the posting of more monitors on Serbia's border with Bosnia to check on his compliance with a pledge to stop arming Serbs in Bosnia.

In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down. The State Education Commission and the Chinese Society for Science and Technology issued an urgent circular this week banning such schools after receiving complaints that the elite schools imposed heavy financial burdens on the families of such children, official reports said Wednesday. The move reflects a national crisis in China's educational system, which is struggling for survival following a withdrawal of most state funding. Despite China's unparalleled affluence in recent years, the number of illiterates has soared -- now accounting for one in five people aged 15 or older, Vice Premier Li Ruihuan said in a recent policy speech. So have drop out rates in the countryside, where many families are unable to afford fees charged for even the most basic schooling. 'China's basic education still falls short of the requirements for promoting material and spiritual civilization, and it continues to face many difficulties and problems that demand prompt solution,' Li said. Along with other areas of the economy, the state has relaxed controls on education, allowing some 60,000 non-government run schools to spring up in recent years.	How do Chinese parents feel about these schools?	1

'I was trying to get together some diapers for my little one, and we were going to the road when we saw the army had already surrounded us.' President Ernesto Zedillo's decision to crack down on the Zapatista National Liberation Army last week was billed as a non-violent effort to arrest Zapatista leaders and restore law and order in Chiapas. But thousands of impoverished peasants who sympathized with rebel demands for Indian rights are taking no chances with the troops this time around. Seven days after the Zapatistas surged out of the jungle to take Morelia and other nearby towns on New Year's Day 1994, the army entered. Villagers alleged that the soldiers arrested three villagers, tortured them and dumped their bodies in the road. The army denied the claims, but an extensive forensic investigation of the mens' remains by the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights corroborated the villagers' claims they had been tortured and murdered.

Joint teams of American and Vietnamese specialists plan Thursday to start investigating the fate of 85 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. A survivor of the bloody 1968 battle at Lang Vei Special Forces camps in central Quang Tri province will help dig for the remains of five of his missing comrades, said Air Force Major Randall Garrett, operations officer for the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi. Frank C. Willoughby, a retired major in the Army's Special Forces -- known as the Green Berets, will return to Lang Vei, where North Vietnamese tanks and infantry overran a base of camps on Feb. 7, 1968, during the Tet Offensive. His participation is unusual, but not unheard of. The search for remains of the 2,211 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the war rarely requires help from survivors of a specific battle, Garrett said. Willoughby is expected to help outline battlefield positions and trace the course of battle to find out where men might have fallen or been buried. Eight teams will spread throughout Vietnam to interview witnesses and excavate at old battlefields, burial sites and areas where U.S. helicopters and airplanes crashed. The planned five-week operation will be the 34th in a series that started in September 1988, Garrett said.	Where were the Americans killed in Vietnam?	1

But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect the continuing decline stems from fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for their sky-blue blood, which is used to screen for toxins in injectable drugs. As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another. The shortage of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food. Now, with the crabs' prime mating season in Florida underway, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is trying enlist help from the public, much in the way it has recruited volunteers to count sea turtles. By reporting on the crabs' night-time trysts, researchers hope to understand not just their habits, but calculate their numbers.	What does Black think about the lack of crabs?	1

That's a sampling of the four dozen comments and protests on the website of the State Water Resources Control Board about emergency water management after the driest winter in decades. From all over California, farmers, environmental lawyers, wildlife groups, cities and even the Fresno County sheriff have posted thoughts in a siege of protests to state officials about the use of this year's puny snowpack and half-empty reservoirs. 'This year is a whole new level of crazy,' said Ara Azhderian of the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority, representing many farmers who are forecast to get zero water this year. Besides fear, exactly what is setting everybody off?	What is the political context of the river Delta?	1

San Joaquin Valley farm groups say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean for nature, robbing the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry. Environmental and fishery groups say agriculture is manipulating the drought crisis to extract delta water, exposing even non-threatened fish and the fishing industry to catastrophic losses.

The argument spilled into the spotlight in February and March, oddly because storms finally began hitting the state after a sunny, disappointingly dry December and January. The February and March storms caused river flow through the delta to spike. And the fight over the extra flow was on. Farmers held massive rallies and pressured lawmakers, pointing to huge increases of outflow both months. Fishing groups and environmentalists wrote impassioned media releases and publicly lambasted officials who allowed some increase in pumping. In the middle of the fray, state and federal agencies were walking a tightrope, emphasizing protection of public health and safety while balancing the other water needs.

	What inspired Dajani to travel to Poland to visit the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp?	1
JERUSALEM - Professor Mohammed Dajani expected criticism when he took Palestinian students to Poland last month to visit the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. But he wasn't prepared for the uproar that followed. In online posts and comments, Palestinian critics denounced the visit as treason. Acquaintances counseled the professor to keep a low profile, stay away from his university campus and consider taking a vacation abroad, he recalled. 'People said we were giving support to Zionism and promoting its propaganda, as if we were giving up on our rights,' Dajani said in an interview in East Jerusalem, the city's Arab side, which Palestinians claim as the capital of a future state. He is no stranger to controversy. The director of the American studies program at Al Quds University, Dajani heads an organization called Wasatia, whose declared aim is to promote a culture of moderation and reconciliation among Palestinians - values that often seem in short supply in the festering conflict with Israel.

Dajani said the idea of taking students to Auschwitz took shape after he made a journey to the site three years ago on a visit sponsored by The Aladdin Project, a Paris-based organization that promotes understanding between Muslims and Jews. 'In my community you see a lot of ignorance of the Holocaust, denial of the Holocaust. People don't want to recognize the suffering of the other,' Dajani said. 'I felt that I did not want to be a bystander, and wanted to bring more awareness and consciousness among Palestinians of this issue'. Because of its crucial role in the creation of Israel, the Holocaust is freighted with political overtones in Palestinian society, where many think that their people have paid the price for the persecution of the Jews in Europe. Palestinians consider their mass displacement and expulsion in the war that followed the establishment of Israel a 'catastrophe' of similar magnitude, and they recall it in annual commemorations just as Jews will mark Holocaust Remembrance Day this year beginning at sundown Sunday.

BEIJING - Two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's equivalent of the Met, performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were having a vaudevillian moment. It was the latest stop on a blitzkrieg winter tour of China for a somewhat motley but certainly merry group of American minstrels definitely not from Hollywood. They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'.

To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them. On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off.	What did the performer say about the equipment?	1

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope. Using a special solar-powered tag, marine scientists now can study a shark's movements for up to two years by way of data beamed to satellites. Previously, researchers relied on tags that ran on batteries and sometimes died before all the information could be transmitted. The new tags are like 'a smartphone for marine animals,' said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices.

The overall success of solar tags has yet to be proven because of their relatively limited use. But so far marine researchers have encountered no serious problems, and a growing number of agencies plan to purchase them, manufactures said. By drawing on solar energy, the tags ensure power is available to beam to a satellite a range of data, including how deep the fish go and the water temperatures they encounter. That information is then transmitted to researchers.	What happens after six months?	1
	Are there any other factors that might influence the child obesity rate?	1
From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families.

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark.

In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.

In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor. In 2003, 86.6 percent of adolescents living with parents who had college degrees told survey-takers that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes continuously sometime in the last seven days. By 2011, 90.1 percent said they had done so. In contrast, 79.8 percent of adolescent children with parents who did not go beyond high school said in 2003 that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes in the previous week. By 2011, the numbers of those adolescents who had done so had barely budged, at 80.4 percent. Asked whether they had engaged in at least 10 minutes of continuous physical activity in the last 30 days, 94.7 percent of adolescents with college-educated parents said yes.

Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products.

By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products.

'It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games,' he said.

FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range.	What does this mean for the population?	1
FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction.	What does this mean for the future of the bighorn sheep?	1

'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'.	How many herds were to be re-introduced?	1

Teams of biologists and volunteers in 2000 began their research, and in 2007 started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn by dispersing them into herds along the Sierra's crest. The agencies designated 16 areas for the bighorns with the initial goal of repopulating 12 of them. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March near Lodgepole is the 10th and next on the list are Laurel Creek on the southern end of Sequoia National Park and Taboose Creek on the eastern border of Kings Canyon National Park. The two parks fully enclose or share a border with 10 of the 16 areas covering about 22 percent of all designated critical habitat across the Sierra, Gammons said.

Law enforcement officials, in turn, fear they might lose an invaluable investigative tool. 'A photograph, short video, letter, list of addresses or other material that could be properly seized from an arrestee's pocket in paper form is not imbued with special First and Fourth Amendment protection simply because it is digitized and carried on a cellphone,' the California attorney general's office wrote in a brief.

The Riley and Wurie cases present different scenarios, and they'll be argued back to back for an hour each on Tuesday morning. Both rest on the warrant-less searches of devices unimagined at the time the Fourth Amendment was ratified in 1791. 'I think the Riley case, in particular, is incredibly important,' Elizabeth B. Wydra, chief counsel of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, said Friday, 'and it should be important for everyone who has a smartphone'.

She also said the halibut stock is not in danger. Bonino said she would ask the EU's executive branch and fisheries ministers of the 15 EU nations to decide quickly whether to start an objection procedure in NAFO against Canada and the vote results. NAFO members agreed last September to a 1995 catch limit of 27,000 tons of Greenland halibut in NAFO-managed international waters outside Canada's 200-mile zone.

	What is the history of the man named by the police as a suspected Serb war criminal?	1
Police arrested a suspected Serb war criminal Tuesday for investigation of charges including accessory to genocide, but a judge later released the man. A judge with the country's highest criminal court questioned the suspect and refused late Tuesday to issue a formal arrest warrant for the man, saying there was not enough evidence for such a move, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said. The man, whose name was withheld, remains under investigation. The suspect was 'not a big fish' and not one of the 21 Serbs accused by an international tribunal in The Hague on Monday, said Ralf Hannich, spokesman for the prosecutor. Those charges set the stage for the first war crimes trial since World War II.	What happened to the people who were accused of plundering and setting fire to Muslim houses?	1

Many were beaten and tortured to death, or died of typhus or other diseases. Sack said at least 20 percent of the total number of inmates died at the 1,255 camps, largely in the Silesia region now in Poland. Stalin deliberately put Jews in charge of many of the camps. The powerful German critic Eike Geisel slammed Sack's book as sadistic sensationalism in a seething polemic that called the work a 'vile docudrama' and a gift to neo-Nazis. Geisel's Jan. 26 review of the book, under the headline 'Anti-Semitic Fodder,' provoked a barrage of complaints to publisher R. Piper of Munich. All 6,000 copies of the German edition were stacked in a Stuttgart warehouse when Piper publisher Viktor Niemann decided they would not reach readers. 'They will be recycled,' he said by telephone on Monday. Niemann said he found neither the story Sack tells nor the American journalist's lively reportage-style presentation credible: 'We want a documentation that is thick and indisputable.'

All 6,000 copies of the German edition were stacked in a Stuttgart warehouse when Piper publisher Viktor Niemann decided they would not reach readers. 'They will be recycled,' he said by telephone on Monday.	What was the main objection that the author raised in his review?	1

The British and Irish governments said they achieved a breakthrough Tuesday on efforts to reach a shared vision of a Northern Ireland political settlement. After 5 1/2 hours of negotiations at Stormont Castle east of Belfast, Britain's senior official in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said they had largely resolved the issues that had slowed down a key part of peacemaking efforts. They declined to discuss specifics of their new areas of agreement before publication of the finished product -- the long-awaited 'framework document' outlining the British-ruled province's future. All factions in Northern Ireland, divided broadly into pro-British Protestant and Irish Catholic camps, are waiting to see which side the document will favor. Spring suggested that may happen next week, 'if everything goes extraordinarily well.' He said he and Mayhew would most likely meet again later this week for 'dotting the i's and crossing the t's,' then present the document to their governments for approval.

The outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that have to be done.' Tuesday's session was the first formal meeting between the two governments since September, the month the Irish Republican Army began observing an open-ended truce. That cease-fire has largely held and -- jointly with a truce by pro-British 'loyalist' groups called in mid-October -- has given Northern Ireland its first extended period of calm since 1969, when British troops were deployed in response to Protestant-Catholic street violence. But efforts to agree on the so-called 'framework document,' spelling out how Britain and the Irish Republic view the likely terms of compromise, had run into trouble.

On Thursday, the president ended a yearlong truce with the leftist Indian rebels in southern Chiapas state, sending thousands of troops to occupy former rebel villages. Federal police fanned out across the state and country to arrest suspected rebels and question sympathizers. The nation's most famed leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, told tens of thousands of protesters in Mexico City on Saturday that Zedillo had started 'a prolonged war that will last many years, causing many deaths.' Yet a day after the angry protest, members of the conservative opposition National Action Party were dancing in the streets of Guadalajara to celebrate what party leaders called a 'victory for democracy.' Zedillo's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, peacefully accepted the worst defeat in its 66-year history in the race for governor of Jalisco state and for mayor of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city.

LOS ANGELES - The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. 'Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,' Hanson said. 'Not very well'. To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast.	How do scientists explain the decline of the fish population?	1

After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. 'Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,' Hanson said. 'Not very well'. To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve.	What is affecting the population?	1

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs from an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, portions of which are torn and decayed. By analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty. The name of Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner, who identified the tomb's occupant with the help of graduate student Kevin Cahail. Some other names on the list are obliterated. 'They basically were forgotten to history,' Wegner said. 'In the later king lists, they don't appear. They just kind of vanish'. The tomb, dated to 1650 B.C., appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said. Even the king's bodily remains were ripped apart. Preliminary work on the skeleton, conducted by Penn graduate students Paul Verhelst and Matthew Olson, suggests that Senebkay stood about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and died in his mid- to late 40s. The tomb contained remains of a funerary mask, a coffin, and a cedar chest that would have been used to house the king's internal organs, customarily removed before burial. The chest apparently had been reused from the nearby tomb of an earlier king who already was known to history. The discovery of that tomb, belonging to a king named Sobekhotep, was announced by the Penn-Egypt team this week.	When did the archaeologists find the tomb of Sobekhotep?	1

LOS ANGELES - Officials of the small town of Willits, Calif., looked at their two municipal reservoirs last week, did some calculating and realized they had enough water to last only 100 days. It was time to adopt the toughest rationing measures they could. The 5,000 residents of this former lumber town in Mendocino County on the edge of redwood country are now on a crash water diet. A family of four isn't supposed to use more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent. 'The more we looked at the data, the more we realized the situation is bleak,' Willits City Manager Adrienne Moore said. As the winter progresses with no break from last year's parched conditions, concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977.	How much rain is coming?	1

'A lot of the smaller systems are going to be really hurting because they really don't have a lot of carry-over' of supplies from one year to the next, said Maury Roos, the state's chief hydrologist. Water managers in Southern California, on the other hand, say they have enough reserves to get the state's most populous region through the year and even into 2015 without rationing. San Francisco's water stores are also in decent shape.	What about other water users besides the Irrigation District?	1

SAN FRANCISCO - A federal appeals court became the first in the nation to rule that prospective jurors may not be excluded because of their sexual orientation, a decision that expands juror protections beyond race and gender and provides legal ammunition to challenge laws that limit gay rights. The sweeping, unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a mixed jury verdict in an antitrust case involving an AIDS drug. The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury. California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said. The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays differently from others, including bans on same-sex marriage, lawyers said. A challenge to Nevada's marriage law is already pending in the 9th Circuit, and gays are fighting marriage bans in trial courts in Oregon, Idaho and Arizona. When a law discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it must be closely evaluated to 'ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status,' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court. The panel said excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Gay rights activists applauded the ruling and predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage was reinstated last summer. 'This is really a very big deal,' said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. 'It is likely to have a significant impact on other cases'. David Codell, constitutional litigation director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the decision would make it 'exceedingly difficult' for states to justify discriminating against gays in all sorts of contexts.

PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. 'Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against. We need to make it sexier and more relevant in a highly competitive market,' said Paul B. Redman, director of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., and a strong supporter of a four-year remedial campaign outlined in the letter. That campaign calls for: A scientific study of the problem to support with numbers what backers believe to be true. An education plan outlining how horticulture can be integrated into K-through-12 curriculums and promoted on college campuses. An advocacy and marketing strategy to raise public awareness of horticulture's importance and of career options. 'We have to come up with a game plan. Period,' said Redman, who has been in horticulture for three decades and who still has to define for people what that means. Which may be the first hurdle this initiative faces - besides funding, which is still an unknown.	What is horticulture?	1

But those colonies have been collapsing, and scientists have attributed that devastation to a deadly cocktail of pathogens, as well as pesticides and beekeeping practices that stress the insect's immune system. In California, the $3 billion almond industry spends $239 million annually to rent more than 1 million beehives, and that cost is escalating. Only about 5 percent of plant viruses are known to be transmitted by pollen, and fewer still have been known to jump from the plant kingdom to insects. That adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse disorder, scientists warned. The tobacco ringspot virus acts as a 'quasi-species,' replicating in a way that creates ample mutations that subvert the host's immune response. That phenomenon is believed to be the driving factor of recurring viral infections of avian and swine influenza and of the persistence of HIV, the study noted.

LOS ANGELES - A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study. Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio. The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a pollen-borne RNA virus that spread systematically through the bees and hives. Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes, according to the study.

An Associated Press analysis in November of more than a decade's worth of Rio state government tests on waterways across the city showed fecal coliform pollution levels far above those considered safe by Brazilian or U.S. law. That pollution means nearly all beaches dotting the 148-square-mile (383-square-kilometer) bay have long been abandoned by swimmers, and some health experts warn of risks to athletes who come into contact with the water. Elite sailors have warned that high-speed collisions with floating detritus could damage or even sink sailboats during the Olympics. Water pollution issues began making headlines in Brazil's local press again in recent days, after thick patches of brown foam appeared along the city's most popular beaches like Copacabana as the Southern Hemisphere summer hits full stride. Rio's beaches, overwhelmed with holiday visitors, have been inundated with trash, much of it floating in water just yards (meters) from the sand. That's where authorities hope the eco-boats will make an impact. They're rectangular crafts made of steel and fitted with powerful speedboat motors and a sieve that traps garbage floating up to 18 inches (45 centimeters) below the water's surface, capturing everything from household trash to bigger items like abandoned television sets and refrigerators. The trash is dumped into the boat, where recyclables are sorted out. The vessels don't address sewage, but authorities insist they'll make a big dent in the overall pollution.

Only 30 percent of Rio's sewage is treated, with the rest flowing into area rivers, the bay, local lagoons and its world-famous beaches. 'Those who live around the bay can already notice a difference over the past two years,' Serva said as the clanking sieve dumped garbage into the ship's hull.	How much do the boats cost?	1

President Clinton has approved a proposal to ease trade and other economic sanctions against Serbia in a new effort to end the war in Bosnia, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. In return, President Slobodan Milosevic would have to recognize Bosnia as a sovereign country, a blow to his hopes for a Greater Serbia, and agree to other conditions designed to end the 34-month ethnic conflict. The aim is to drive a wedge between Milosevic and the Serbs in Bosnia who have rejected past peace proposals by isolating them from their patrons and arms suppliers in Belgrade.

In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down. The State Education Commission and the Chinese Society for Science and Technology issued an urgent circular this week banning such schools after receiving complaints that the elite schools imposed heavy financial burdens on the families of such children, official reports said Wednesday. The move reflects a national crisis in China's educational system, which is struggling for survival following a withdrawal of most state funding. Despite China's unparalleled affluence in recent years, the number of illiterates has soared -- now accounting for one in five people aged 15 or older, Vice Premier Li Ruihuan said in a recent policy speech. So have drop out rates in the countryside, where many families are unable to afford fees charged for even the most basic schooling. 'China's basic education still falls short of the requirements for promoting material and spiritual civilization, and it continues to face many difficulties and problems that demand prompt solution,' Li said. Along with other areas of the economy, the state has relaxed controls on education, allowing some 60,000 non-government run schools to spring up in recent years. Such schools cater to the desire of Chinese parents to improve their childrens' chances of advancing to secondary school and university, at whatever the cost. The elitist nature of such 'Olympic schools,' as they are called, apparently angered Li and other top leaders, who recently began calling for their closure. Although basic education is theoretically supposed to be provided free to all children, many schools, especially the best equipped ones, have begun charging exorbitant fees, official reports say.

His participation is unusual, but not unheard of. The search for remains of the 2,211 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the war rarely requires help from survivors of a specific battle, Garrett said. Willoughby is expected to help outline battlefield positions and trace the course of battle to find out where men might have fallen or been buried. Eight teams will spread throughout Vietnam to interview witnesses and excavate at old battlefields, burial sites and areas where U.S. helicopters and airplanes crashed. The planned five-week operation will be the 34th in a series that started in September 1988, Garrett said.

The U.S. Defense Department lists 1,621 Americans as missing in Vietnam, but only 55 of them were last seen alive and in imminent danger of being captured. Most were killed in action or lost over the ocean, but their bodies were never recovered, defense officials say. Another 505 U.S. servicemen are unaccounted for in Laos, 77 in Cambodia and eight in China.	What recent development has occurred between the United States and Vietnam?	1
	What is an example of a situation where a moonlit beach is particularly romantic?	1
MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high. Every spring, from Florida to New Jersey, crabs that look more like fossils than a postcard for passion make their way ashore by the thousands when the moon is bright to lay millions of eggs that provide critical food for migrating shorebirds. But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling.	What is the relationship between the declining numbers of horseshoe crabs and other factors such as fishing, loss of habitat, and global demand for their blood?	1

But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect the continuing decline stems from fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for their sky-blue blood, which is used to screen for toxins in injectable drugs. As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another. The shortage of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food. Now, with the crabs' prime mating season in Florida underway, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is trying enlist help from the public, much in the way it has recruited volunteers to count sea turtles.

Starting in 2002, the agency has held an annual spring survey, collecting numbers on sightings around the state. So far, people have reported spotting crabs a total of 2,800 times, enough to get an idea about where they may be located, but not enough to tell researchers about populations, Black explained. 'If we can get people working regularly, even if just for a few months of the year, from March, on a full moon … that shows us something,' she said. 'You need multiple years of data from the same place, at the same time, to do any sort of analysis'.	What is unique about the horseshoe crab species?	1

FRESNO, Calif. - California water authorities are killing salmon and destroying farming. They're endangering shorebirds, threatening city taps and quite possibly raising the crime rate. That's a sampling of the four dozen comments and protests on the website of the State Water Resources Control Board about emergency water management after the driest winter in decades. From all over California, farmers, environmental lawyers, wildlife groups, cities and even the Fresno County sheriff have posted thoughts in a siege of protests to state officials about the use of this year's puny snowpack and half-empty reservoirs. 'This year is a whole new level of crazy,' said Ara Azhderian of the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority, representing many farmers who are forecast to get zero water this year. Besides fear, exactly what is setting everybody off? Mostly, it's about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta - a perennial California argument filled with suspicion, lawsuits and politics.	When did the argument about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean become a prominent issue?	1

Mostly, it's about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta - a perennial California argument filled with suspicion, lawsuits and politics. San Joaquin Valley farm groups say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean for nature, robbing the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry. Environmental and fishery groups say agriculture is manipulating the drought crisis to extract delta water, exposing even non-threatened fish and the fishing industry to catastrophic losses.

JERUSALEM - Professor Mohammed Dajani expected criticism when he took Palestinian students to Poland last month to visit the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. But he wasn't prepared for the uproar that followed. In online posts and comments, Palestinian critics denounced the visit as treason. Acquaintances counseled the professor to keep a low profile, stay away from his university campus and consider taking a vacation abroad, he recalled. 'People said we were giving support to Zionism and promoting its propaganda, as if we were giving up on our rights,' Dajani said in an interview in East Jerusalem, the city's Arab side, which Palestinians claim as the capital of a future state. He is no stranger to controversy. The director of the American studies program at Al Quds University, Dajani heads an organization called Wasatia, whose declared aim is to promote a culture of moderation and reconciliation among Palestinians - values that often seem in short supply in the festering conflict with Israel. Dajani said the idea of taking students to Auschwitz took shape after he made a journey to the site three years ago on a visit sponsored by The Aladdin Project, a Paris-based organization that promotes understanding between Muslims and Jews.

Dajani said the idea of taking students to Auschwitz took shape after he made a journey to the site three years ago on a visit sponsored by The Aladdin Project, a Paris-based organization that promotes understanding between Muslims and Jews. 'In my community you see a lot of ignorance of the Holocaust, denial of the Holocaust. People don't want to recognize the suffering of the other,' Dajani said. 'I felt that I did not want to be a bystander, and wanted to bring more awareness and consciousness among Palestinians of this issue'. Because of its crucial role in the creation of Israel, the Holocaust is freighted with political overtones in Palestinian society, where many think that their people have paid the price for the persecution of the Jews in Europe. Palestinians consider their mass displacement and expulsion in the war that followed the establishment of Israel a 'catastrophe' of similar magnitude, and they recall it in annual commemorations just as Jews will mark Holocaust Remembrance Day this year beginning at sundown Sunday. 'The Holocaust is not taught in Palestinian schools and universities,' Dajani said. 'It is a history ignored, mentioned as part of a plot to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, or as Zionist propaganda with exaggerated figures'. Dajani has advocated publicly for Holocaust education among Palestinians and has devoted part of his own classes to the subject.

	What issue did the performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra encounter before their show at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing?	1
BEIJING - Two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's equivalent of the Met, performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were having a vaudevillian moment. It was the latest stop on a blitzkrieg winter tour of China for a somewhat motley but certainly merry group of American minstrels definitely not from Hollywood. They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'. To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them.

They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'. To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them. On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off. Nearby, percussionist Chris Nolan briefly had steam coming out of his ears. 'Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!' he exclaimed, pointing at the pitted and sagging drum heads. Stagehands with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and the local promoter buzzed around the stage, trying to figure out what to do. But as they say in Hollywood, the show must go on, and so it did. (Nolan got his new drum heads 20 minutes before the curtain went up for the show, called 'Classic Oscar: The American Hollywood Film Orchestra New Year's Audio-Visual Concert'.) At 7:30 p.m., conductor Jason Altieri took to the podium, raised his baton and launched the group into Berlioz's 'Rakoczi March'. Its ostensible Oscar connection? Well, there was none, but the song was included in the 1966 French film 'La Grande Vadrouille,' which, judging from the accompanying clips on a giant screen at the rear of the stage, was a slapstick comedy with lots of Nazis. The orchestra's grueling schedule - 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, 11 p.m. dinners, with travel, rehearsal and performances in between - attests to the popularity of Hollywood fare in China as well as the seemingly insatiable demand for Western orchestral music as the country invests heavily in new concert venues and classical music education. In just the last few months, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Diego Symphony, the BBC Concert Orchestra, Canada's National Arts Center Orchestra and even Pierce College's L.A. Symphonic Winds have staged China tours. Also known as the Hollywood Concert Orchestra and the Hollywood Festival Orchestra, the movie-themed ensemble has been making the rounds in China for the last several years.

Sharks are critical to the overall balance of ocean ecosystems, but commercial fishermen catch them by the millions for their fins, cartilage and meat. 'We've learned a lot from tagging sharks, not least of which is that they are highly migratory,' said Antonio Fins, executive director of the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation, which supports the institute. 'They are not American sharks or Bahamian sharks or Mexican sharks. They don't know borders or nationalities'. About 40 research agencies already use solar tags, which were put on the market two years ago. For instance, the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Sciences studies a variety of sharks, while others use them to track turtles and marine mammals that spend time in the sun.

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse.

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead.	How did physical activity contribute to the divergent trend in obesity rates between rich and poor adolescents?	1

In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor. In 2003, 86.6 percent of adolescents living with parents who had college degrees told survey-takers that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes continuously sometime in the last seven days. By 2011, 90.1 percent said they had done so.

What is the reason for the limited success in reducing obesity rates among adolescents from poorer, less well-educated families?	1
ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products. Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies.

Among the watchers was Armando Ortega, a city official who back in 1983 got a tip from a landfill employee about the massive dump of games. 'It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games,' he said. They braved the darkness, coyotes and snakes of the desert landfill and had to sneak past the security guard. But it paid off. He says they found dozens of crushed cartridges that they took home and were still playable in their game consoles. The game and its contribution to the demise of Atari have been the source of fascination for video game enthusiasts for 30 years. The search for the cartridges will be featured in an upcoming documentary about the biggest video game company of the early '80s. Xbox Entertainment Studios is one of the companies developing the film, which is expected to be released later this year on Microsoft's Xbox game consoles.

FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction.

The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'.

EU delegates boycotted the vote, and Bonino said Tuesday EU fishermen would ignore the allotment and fish the region as before. 'The EU fishermen will not interrupt their fishing,' she told the Parliament. Dividing the catch among NAFO members 'sets a dangerous precedent for the future,' she added. She also said the halibut stock is not in danger. Bonino said she would ask the EU's executive branch and fisheries ministers of the 15 EU nations to decide quickly whether to start an objection procedure in NAFO against Canada and the vote results. NAFO members agreed last September to a 1995 catch limit of 27,000 tons of Greenland halibut in NAFO-managed international waters outside Canada's 200-mile zone.

'This is the greatest filth,' Ralph Giordano, a German Jewish writer, said of Sack's book. He has not read it, but nevertheless had no trouble calling it 'vulgar artistic fetish.' Citing the German Federal Archives, Sack says 60,000 to 80,000 ethnic Germans died from 1945 to 1948 at internment camps Stalin set up through the Polish Communist government's Office of State Security. Many were beaten and tortured to death, or died of typhus or other diseases. Sack said at least 20 percent of the total number of inmates died at the 1,255 camps, largely in the Silesia region now in Poland. Stalin deliberately put Jews in charge of many of the camps. The powerful German critic Eike Geisel slammed Sack's book as sadistic sensationalism in a seething polemic that called the work a 'vile docudrama' and a gift to neo-Nazis. Geisel's Jan. 26 review of the book, under the headline 'Anti-Semitic Fodder,' provoked a barrage of complaints to publisher R. Piper of Munich. All 6,000 copies of the German edition were stacked in a Stuttgart warehouse when Piper publisher Viktor Niemann decided they would not reach readers. 'They will be recycled,' he said by telephone on Monday. Niemann said he found neither the story Sack tells nor the American journalist's lively reportage-style presentation credible: 'We want a documentation that is thick and indisputable.'

American Allen Johnson set a world best in the 110-meter hurdles Tuesday at the Russian winter track and field championships, winning with a clocking of 13:34 seconds. The distance is not often run indoors where the world hurdles records are recognized at 50 meters or 60 meters. Olympic champion Mark McKoy, formerly of Canada, now an Austrian citizen, was second, 0:04 seconds behind Johnson. McKoy holds the world record at 50 meters. The previous best indoors for the 110-meter hurdles was 13.58 seconds. England's Colin Jackson holds the outdoor mark for the 110 meters at 12.91. Johnson ran collegiately for North Carolina. Russian walker Mikhail Shchennikov set a record in the 5-kilometer walk, circling the a wooden track in 18.07.08 minutes.

The British and Irish governments said they achieved a breakthrough Tuesday on efforts to reach a shared vision of a Northern Ireland political settlement. After 5 1/2 hours of negotiations at Stormont Castle east of Belfast, Britain's senior official in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said they had largely resolved the issues that had slowed down a key part of peacemaking efforts. They declined to discuss specifics of their new areas of agreement before publication of the finished product -- the long-awaited 'framework document' outlining the British-ruled province's future. All factions in Northern Ireland, divided broadly into pro-British Protestant and Irish Catholic camps, are waiting to see which side the document will favor. Spring suggested that may happen next week, 'if everything goes extraordinarily well.' He said he and Mayhew would most likely meet again later this week for 'dotting the i's and crossing the t's,' then present the document to their governments for approval. Mayhew was more cautious, saying at a separate press conference: 'Some important obstacles have been overcome. The outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that have to be done.' Tuesday's session was the first formal meeting between the two governments since September, the month the Irish Republican Army began observing an open-ended truce. That cease-fire has largely held and -- jointly with a truce by pro-British 'loyalist' groups called in mid-October -- has given Northern Ireland its first extended period of calm since 1969, when British troops were deployed in response to Protestant-Catholic street violence. But efforts to agree on the so-called 'framework document,' spelling out how Britain and the Irish Republic view the likely terms of compromise, had run into trouble.

Protestant politicians, determined to maintain Northern Ireland's union with Britain, fear that the British-Irish document will endorse the notion of a cross-border authority of politicians and bureaucrats. As envisioned, the body would set policy on tourism, transport and relations with the 15-nation European Union on behalf of separate parliaments in Dublin and Belfast, treating the independent south and British-ruled north as one unit.

	What specific action did Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin call on Yasser Arafat to take in regards to anti-Israel violence?	1
Yasser Arafat must carry out a pledge to reign in anti-Israel violence, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday, calling on the Palestinian leader to outlaw two groups responsible for bombing attacks. Addressing Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Rabin revealed that Israel has in recent months arrested 2,400 Palestinians on suspicion of militant activities.

President Ernesto Zedillo seems to be pushing Mexico toward greater democracy and freer elections while wielding a club to help him keep his political balance. But how this will improve the lives of most Mexicans remains to be seen. On Thursday, the president ended a yearlong truce with the leftist Indian rebels in southern Chiapas state, sending thousands of troops to occupy former rebel villages. Federal police fanned out across the state and country to arrest suspected rebels and question sympathizers. The nation's most famed leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, told tens of thousands of protesters in Mexico City on Saturday that Zedillo had started 'a prolonged war that will last many years, causing many deaths.'

The nation's most famed leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, told tens of thousands of protesters in Mexico City on Saturday that Zedillo had started 'a prolonged war that will last many years, causing many deaths.' Yet a day after the angry protest, members of the conservative opposition National Action Party were dancing in the streets of Guadalajara to celebrate what party leaders called a 'victory for democracy.' Zedillo's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, peacefully accepted the worst defeat in its 66-year history in the race for governor of Jalisco state and for mayor of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. While the PAN landslide in Jalisco may broaden faith in electoral results, cleaner elections are likely to have little effect on the large gap between the rich and poor and the lack of a significant middle class. In the hills of Chiapas, too, people are reacting to government intervention the way they traditionally have -- with fear. Villages have been abandoned by peasants who may not belong to the Zapatista rebels, but who don't want to be mistaken for one.

LOS ANGELES - The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. 'Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,' Hanson said. 'Not very well'. To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast.

If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72 percent since its last peak in 2006. Spawning has taken a dive too. In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright. 'We shouldn't be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,' said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery.	What is the typical behavior of sardine populations and how do they respond to changes in the ocean environment?	1
PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs from an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, portions of which are torn and decayed. By analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty. The name of Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner, who identified the tomb's occupant with the help of graduate student Kevin Cahail. Some other names on the list are obliterated. 'They basically were forgotten to history,' Wegner said. 'In the later king lists, they don't appear.

LOS ANGELES - Officials of the small town of Willits, Calif., looked at their two municipal reservoirs last week, did some calculating and realized they had enough water to last only 100 days. It was time to adopt the toughest rationing measures they could. The 5,000 residents of this former lumber town in Mendocino County on the edge of redwood country are now on a crash water diet. A family of four isn't supposed to use more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent. 'The more we looked at the data, the more we realized the situation is bleak,' Willits City Manager Adrienne Moore said. As the winter progresses with no break from last year's parched conditions, concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977. The snow and rain could still come. Only about half the rainy season is over. But if monotonously sunny weather continues to curse the state, the pain of water shortages will spread, albeit unevenly. 'A lot of the smaller systems are going to be really hurting because they really don't have a lot of carry-over' of supplies from one year to the next, said Maury Roos, the state's chief hydrologist. Water managers in Southern California, on the other hand, say they have enough reserves to get the state's most populous region through the year and even into 2015 without rationing.

SAN FRANCISCO - A federal appeals court became the first in the nation to rule that prospective jurors may not be excluded because of their sexual orientation, a decision that expands juror protections beyond race and gender and provides legal ammunition to challenge laws that limit gay rights. The sweeping, unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a mixed jury verdict in an antitrust case involving an AIDS drug. The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury. California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said.

California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said. The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays differently from others, including bans on same-sex marriage, lawyers said. A challenge to Nevada's marriage law is already pending in the 9th Circuit, and gays are fighting marriage bans in trial courts in Oregon, Idaho and Arizona. When a law discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it must be closely evaluated to 'ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status,' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court. The panel said excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Gay rights activists applauded the ruling and predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage was reinstated last summer. 'This is really a very big deal,' said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. 'It is likely to have a significant impact on other cases'. David Codell, constitutional litigation director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the decision would make it 'exceedingly difficult' for states to justify discriminating against gays in all sorts of contexts. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham Corp., now GlaxoSmithKline, against Abbott Laboratories. The case involved a decision by Abbott to raise the price of an AIDS drug, a move that infuriated the gay community.

LOS ANGELES - A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study. Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio.

LOS ANGELES - A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study. Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio. The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a pollen-borne RNA virus that spread systematically through the bees and hives. Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes, according to the study. Commercially cultivated bees pollinate about 90 crops worldwide, a service valued at $14 billion annually. But those colonies have been collapsing, and scientists have attributed that devastation to a deadly cocktail of pathogens, as well as pesticides and beekeeping practices that stress the insect's immune system. In California, the $3 billion almond industry spends $239 million annually to rent more than 1 million beehives, and that cost is escalating. Only about 5 percent of plant viruses are known to be transmitted by pollen, and fewer still have been known to jump from the plant kingdom to insects. That adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse disorder, scientists warned.	What is the reason behind the tobacco ringspot virus contributing to the collapse of honeybee colonies?	1

At low tide, mountains of household refuse, old sofas and even washing machines are seen. An Associated Press analysis in November of more than a decade's worth of Rio state government tests on waterways across the city showed fecal coliform pollution levels far above those considered safe by Brazilian or U.S. law. That pollution means nearly all beaches dotting the 148-square-mile (383-square-kilometer) bay have long been abandoned by swimmers, and some health experts warn of risks to athletes who come into contact with the water. Elite sailors have warned that high-speed collisions with floating detritus could damage or even sink sailboats during the Olympics. Water pollution issues began making headlines in Brazil's local press again in recent days, after thick patches of brown foam appeared along the city's most popular beaches like Copacabana as the Southern Hemisphere summer hits full stride. Rio's beaches, overwhelmed with holiday visitors, have been inundated with trash, much of it floating in water just yards (meters) from the sand. That's where authorities hope the eco-boats will make an impact.	What happens to the garbage collected by the eco-boats in Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay?	1

Rio's beaches, overwhelmed with holiday visitors, have been inundated with trash, much of it floating in water just yards (meters) from the sand. That's where authorities hope the eco-boats will make an impact. They're rectangular crafts made of steel and fitted with powerful speedboat motors and a sieve that traps garbage floating up to 18 inches (45 centimeters) below the water's surface, capturing everything from household trash to bigger items like abandoned television sets and refrigerators. The trash is dumped into the boat, where recyclables are sorted out. The vessels don't address sewage, but authorities insist they'll make a big dent in the overall pollution. 'Our objective is to not to have floating garbage in Guanabara Bay,' said Gelson Serva, who heads the state government's latest bay cleanup program, an $840 million project that includes efforts to expand the capacity of the city's strained sewage treatment system. Only 30 percent of Rio's sewage is treated, with the rest flowing into area rivers, the bay, local lagoons and its world-famous beaches. 'Those who live around the bay can already notice a difference over the past two years,' Serva said as the clanking sieve dumped garbage into the ship's hull.

LOS ANGELES - The booming illegal international wildlife trade forced conservationists to do the unthinkable Tuesday: Brand the golden domes of two of the rarest tortoises on Earth to reduce their black market value by making it easier for authorities to trace them if stolen. 'It's heartbreaking that it's come to this, but it's the right thing to do,' Paul Gibbons, managing director of the nonprofit Turtle Conservancy's Behler Chelonian Center in Ventura County, said as he gently placed a 30-pound adult female ploughshare tortoise on a small table. With a steady hand and an electric engraving tool, he carved an identification code on the high, rounded shell as the creature with weary eyes and gleaming carapace peered calmly into the distance. The tortoise was branded for life, which in her case would be roughly 160 years. 'We've blemished her natural beauty, so she's just a number in a system now,' Gibbons said. 7001 MG'. The 2-inch- by-1 1/2-inch block figures were placed at the top of the turtle's back, a location chosen to avoid interfering with the expansion of the shell, which grows at the edges. The Conservancy's goal is to mark every one of the estimated 360 ploughshares in captive breeding programs around the world and the 300 believed to be remaining in the wild. So far, no rare tortoise or turtle with identification markings has turned up in illegal markets monitored by law enforcement authorities, conservationists said. Decades of intense collecting, hunting and habitat destruction have brought that species and dozens of others to the brink of extinction.

Milosevic would be required to recognize three other former Yugoslav republics, Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia, thereby acknowledging the breakup of what once was Yugoslavia, and permit stricter policing of his border with Bosnia. At the United Nations, a spokesman said Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 'would welcome mutual recognition between the successor states of the former Yugoslavia and, in those circumstances, the lifting of the sanctions imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.' The spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said Boutros-Ghali favors 'any development which will make it possible for the Security Council to maintain' U.N. protection forces in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said Boutros-Ghali favors 'any development which will make it possible for the Security Council to maintain' U.N. protection forces in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Weapons are still getting through to the Serbs in Bosnia despite a pledge by Milosevic to cut them off, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under the proposed deal, Milosevic would have to agree to the posting of more monitors on Serbia's border with Bosnia to check on his compliance with a pledge to stop arming Serbs in Bosnia. The official stressed the sanctions would be lifted only temporarily and would be reimposed if the Serbian leader reneged. Unaffected by the plan, he said, would be Serbia's 'illegitimacy' status on the world stage -- its exclusion from the World Bank and other international groups. The plan will be presented to Milosevic in the next few days, the official said. Representatives of the so-called Contact Group -- from the United States, Britain, France, Russia and Germany -- that has sought in vain for a peace formula met in Paris Tuesday, but participants declined to talk to reporters after the meeting.

In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down. The State Education Commission and the Chinese Society for Science and Technology issued an urgent circular this week banning such schools after receiving complaints that the elite schools imposed heavy financial burdens on the families of such children, official reports said Wednesday. The move reflects a national crisis in China's educational system, which is struggling for survival following a withdrawal of most state funding. Despite China's unparalleled affluence in recent years, the number of illiterates has soared -- now accounting for one in five people aged 15 or older, Vice Premier Li Ruihuan said in a recent policy speech. So have drop out rates in the countryside, where many families are unable to afford fees charged for even the most basic schooling. 'China's basic education still falls short of the requirements for promoting material and spiritual civilization, and it continues to face many difficulties and problems that demand prompt solution,' Li said. Along with other areas of the economy, the state has relaxed controls on education, allowing some 60,000 non-government run schools to spring up in recent years. Such schools cater to the desire of Chinese parents to improve their childrens' chances of advancing to secondary school and university, at whatever the cost. The elitist nature of such 'Olympic schools,' as they are called, apparently angered Li and other top leaders, who recently began calling for their closure. Although basic education is theoretically supposed to be provided free to all children, many schools, especially the best equipped ones, have begun charging exorbitant fees, official reports say.

Willoughby is expected to help outline battlefield positions and trace the course of battle to find out where men might have fallen or been buried. Eight teams will spread throughout Vietnam to interview witnesses and excavate at old battlefields, burial sites and areas where U.S. helicopters and airplanes crashed. The planned five-week operation will be the 34th in a series that started in September 1988, Garrett said. The U.S. Defense Department lists 1,621 Americans as missing in Vietnam, but only 55 of them were last seen alive and in imminent danger of being captured. Most were killed in action or lost over the ocean, but their bodies were never recovered, defense officials say. Another 505 U.S. servicemen are unaccounted for in Laos, 77 in Cambodia and eight in China.	How many U.S. servicemen are unaccounted for from the Vietnam War?	1
	What is the best time to go to the beach for a romantic evening?	1
MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high. Every spring, from Florida to New Jersey, crabs that look more like fossils than a postcard for passion make their way ashore by the thousands when the moon is bright to lay millions of eggs that provide critical food for migrating shorebirds. But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling.	What is the connection between horseshoe crabs and the decline in their population?	1
MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high. Every spring, from Florida to New Jersey, crabs that look more like fossils than a postcard for passion make their way ashore by the thousands when the moon is bright to lay millions of eggs that provide critical food for migrating shorebirds. But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect the continuing decline stems from fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for their sky-blue blood, which is used to screen for toxins in injectable drugs. As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another. The shortage of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food. Now, with the crabs' prime mating season in Florida underway, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is trying enlist help from the public, much in the way it has recruited volunteers to count sea turtles.

But it's one of these things that's maligned and overlooked, and the more information the better'. Starting in 2002, the agency has held an annual spring survey, collecting numbers on sightings around the state. So far, people have reported spotting crabs a total of 2,800 times, enough to get an idea about where they may be located, but not enough to tell researchers about populations, Black explained. 'If we can get people working regularly, even if just for a few months of the year, from March, on a full moon … that shows us something,' she said. 'You need multiple years of data from the same place, at the same time, to do any sort of analysis'. The horseshoe crab is not really a crab at all but a relative of the spider. It is one of the oldest unchanged species on Earth known to scientists, older than the continents, and exists only in parts of Asia and North America's Atlantic coast.

FRESNO, Calif. - California water authorities are killing salmon and destroying farming. They're endangering shorebirds, threatening city taps and quite possibly raising the crime rate. That's a sampling of the four dozen comments and protests on the website of the State Water Resources Control Board about emergency water management after the driest winter in decades. From all over California, farmers, environmental lawyers, wildlife groups, cities and even the Fresno County sheriff have posted thoughts in a siege of protests to state officials about the use of this year's puny snowpack and half-empty reservoirs. 'This year is a whole new level of crazy,' said Ara Azhderian of the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority, representing many farmers who are forecast to get zero water this year. Besides fear, exactly what is setting everybody off? Mostly, it's about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta - a perennial California argument filled with suspicion, lawsuits and politics. San Joaquin Valley farm groups say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean for nature, robbing the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry.	What are the two sides arguing about?	1

JERUSALEM - Professor Mohammed Dajani expected criticism when he took Palestinian students to Poland last month to visit the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. But he wasn't prepared for the uproar that followed. In online posts and comments, Palestinian critics denounced the visit as treason. Acquaintances counseled the professor to keep a low profile, stay away from his university campus and consider taking a vacation abroad, he recalled. 'People said we were giving support to Zionism and promoting its propaganda, as if we were giving up on our rights,' Dajani said in an interview in East Jerusalem, the city's Arab side, which Palestinians claim as the capital of a future state. He is no stranger to controversy. The director of the American studies program at Al Quds University, Dajani heads an organization called Wasatia, whose declared aim is to promote a culture of moderation and reconciliation among Palestinians - values that often seem in short supply in the festering conflict with Israel. Dajani said the idea of taking students to Auschwitz took shape after he made a journey to the site three years ago on a visit sponsored by The Aladdin Project, a Paris-based organization that promotes understanding between Muslims and Jews. 'In my community you see a lot of ignorance of the Holocaust, denial of the Holocaust. People don't want to recognize the suffering of the other,' Dajani said. 'I felt that I did not want to be a bystander, and wanted to bring more awareness and consciousness among Palestinians of this issue'. Because of its crucial role in the creation of Israel, the Holocaust is freighted with political overtones in Palestinian society, where many think that their people have paid the price for the persecution of the Jews in Europe. Palestinians consider their mass displacement and expulsion in the war that followed the establishment of Israel a 'catastrophe' of similar magnitude, and they recall it in annual commemorations just as Jews will mark Holocaust Remembrance Day this year beginning at sundown Sunday. 'The Holocaust is not taught in Palestinian schools and universities,' Dajani said.	What was the purpose of the trip to Auschwitz?	1

The new tags are like 'a smartphone for marine animals,' said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices. 'Just like smartphones, the tags have many sensors and communication capability'. The Guy Harvey Research Institute, based in Dania Beach, Fla., is looking to use the solar tags to track certain species of the fierce fish, including tigers, makos, hammerheads, oceanic white tip and sand sharks. The goal is to better understand their migratory patterns and ultimately keep their population healthy. Sharks are critical to the overall balance of ocean ecosystems, but commercial fishermen catch them by the millions for their fins, cartilage and meat. 'We've learned a lot from tagging sharks, not least of which is that they are highly migratory,' said Antonio Fins, executive director of the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation, which supports the institute. 'They are not American sharks or Bahamian sharks or Mexican sharks. They don't know borders or nationalities'. About 40 research agencies already use solar tags, which were put on the market two years ago. For instance, the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Sciences studies a variety of sharks, while others use them to track turtles and marine mammals that spend time in the sun. The overall success of solar tags has yet to be proven because of their relatively limited use. But so far marine researchers have encountered no serious problems, and a growing number of agencies plan to purchase them, manufactures said.	What is the range of data that the tags can collect?	1
From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse.

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark.	What are some of the health gaps between rich and poor that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely?	1

But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products. Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies. Among the watchers was Armando Ortega, a city official who back in 1983 got a tip from a landfill employee about the massive dump of games. 'It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games,' he said. They braved the darkness, coyotes and snakes of the desert landfill and had to sneak past the security guard.	What was the purpose of burying the 'E.T.' game cartridges?	1
FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction.

'This shows that recovery is actually feasible and possible,' says Daniel Gammons, biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. 'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists.	What is the cost of the recovery effort?	1

The presses were already rolling when the German publisher decided last week to scrap publication of 'An Eye for an Eye: The Untold Story of Jewish Revenge Against Germans in 1945.' The book by American journalist John Sack, published in the United States in 1993, was deemed inappropriate for German readers: a chronicle of Jewish concentration camp survivors taking murderous revenge on Germans in postwar internment camps. Although Sack's facts were not disputed, Germany's cultural elite decided the book was not a serious work and, worse, could be exploited by right-wing extremists to try to diminish the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews. German intellectuals do not dispute that some Jews committed atrocities against innocent Germans immediately after the war, but find it understandable considering the evil the Nazis unleashed. In a country where skinhead hate-mongers periodically firebomb refugee homes, many feel they have a special responsibility to shield the public from anything that could fuel a neo-Nazi resurgence. 'This is the greatest filth,' Ralph Giordano, a German Jewish writer, said of Sack's book. He has not read it, but nevertheless had no trouble calling it 'vulgar artistic fetish.'

'This is the greatest filth,' Ralph Giordano, a German Jewish writer, said of Sack's book. He has not read it, but nevertheless had no trouble calling it 'vulgar artistic fetish.' Citing the German Federal Archives, Sack says 60,000 to 80,000 ethnic Germans died from 1945 to 1948 at internment camps Stalin set up through the Polish Communist government's Office of State Security. Many were beaten and tortured to death, or died of typhus or other diseases. Sack said at least 20 percent of the total number of inmates died at the 1,255 camps, largely in the Silesia region now in Poland. Stalin deliberately put Jews in charge of many of the camps. The powerful German critic Eike Geisel slammed Sack's book as sadistic sensationalism in a seething polemic that called the work a 'vile docudrama' and a gift to neo-Nazis. Geisel's Jan. 26 review of the book, under the headline 'Anti-Semitic Fodder,' provoked a barrage of complaints to publisher R. Piper of Munich. All 6,000 copies of the German edition were stacked in a Stuttgart warehouse when Piper publisher Viktor Niemann decided they would not reach readers. 'They will be recycled,' he said by telephone on Monday. Niemann said he found neither the story Sack tells nor the American journalist's lively reportage-style presentation credible: 'We want a documentation that is thick and indisputable.'

The British and Irish governments said they achieved a breakthrough Tuesday on efforts to reach a shared vision of a Northern Ireland political settlement.	What are the two sides negotiating for?	1
The British and Irish governments said they achieved a breakthrough Tuesday on efforts to reach a shared vision of a Northern Ireland political settlement. After 5 1/2 hours of negotiations at Stormont Castle east of Belfast, Britain's senior official in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said they had largely resolved the issues that had slowed down a key part of peacemaking efforts. They declined to discuss specifics of their new areas of agreement before publication of the finished product -- the long-awaited 'framework document' outlining the British-ruled province's future. All factions in Northern Ireland, divided broadly into pro-British Protestant and Irish Catholic camps, are waiting to see which side the document will favor. Spring suggested that may happen next week, 'if everything goes extraordinarily well.' He said he and Mayhew would most likely meet again later this week for 'dotting the i's and crossing the t's,' then present the document to their governments for approval.

Mayhew was more cautious, saying at a separate press conference: 'Some important obstacles have been overcome. The outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that have to be done.' Tuesday's session was the first formal meeting between the two governments since September, the month the Irish Republican Army began observing an open-ended truce. That cease-fire has largely held and -- jointly with a truce by pro-British 'loyalist' groups called in mid-October -- has given Northern Ireland its first extended period of calm since 1969, when British troops were deployed in response to Protestant-Catholic street violence. But efforts to agree on the so-called 'framework document,' spelling out how Britain and the Irish Republic view the likely terms of compromise, had run into trouble. Protestant politicians, determined to maintain Northern Ireland's union with Britain, fear that the British-Irish document will endorse the notion of a cross-border authority of politicians and bureaucrats.

The British and Irish governments said they achieved a breakthrough Tuesday on efforts to reach a shared vision of a Northern Ireland political settlement. After 5 1/2 hours of negotiations at Stormont Castle east of Belfast, Britain's senior official in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said they had largely resolved the issues that had slowed down a key part of peacemaking efforts. They declined to discuss specifics of their new areas of agreement before publication of the finished product -- the long-awaited 'framework document' outlining the British-ruled province's future. All factions in Northern Ireland, divided broadly into pro-British Protestant and Irish Catholic camps, are waiting to see which side the document will favor.

	What two groups did Rabin call on Arafat to ban?	1
Yasser Arafat must carry out a pledge to reign in anti-Israel violence, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday, calling on the Palestinian leader to outlaw two groups responsible for bombing attacks. Addressing Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Rabin revealed that Israel has in recent months arrested 2,400 Palestinians on suspicion of militant activities. That brings the total of Palestinians held by Israel to nearly 6,000.	What are the two groups responsible for the bombing attacks?	1

The fundamentalist groups, which oppose the Israel-PLO peace process, claimed bombing attacks that have killed 56 Israelis since October. During peace talks in Washington on Sunday, Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath pledged the PLO in writing to 'pre-empting terror, punishing those responsible and denying those who plan and carry out terror or violence any safe haven.' Rabin stressed he expected Arafat to disarm and prosecute the militants. 'We have made clear that the main obstacle in implementing what was and will be achieved in the negotiations is the terrorism,' Rabin said.

President Ernesto Zedillo seems to be pushing Mexico toward greater democracy and freer elections while wielding a club to help him keep his political balance. But how this will improve the lives of most Mexicans remains to be seen. On Thursday, the president ended a yearlong truce with the leftist Indian rebels in southern Chiapas state, sending thousands of troops to occupy former rebel villages. Federal police fanned out across the state and country to arrest suspected rebels and question sympathizers. The nation's most famed leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, told tens of thousands of protesters in Mexico City on Saturday that Zedillo had started 'a prolonged war that will last many years, causing many deaths.' Yet a day after the angry protest, members of the conservative opposition National Action Party were dancing in the streets of Guadalajara to celebrate what party leaders called a 'victory for democracy.' Zedillo's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, peacefully accepted the worst defeat in its 66-year history in the race for governor of Jalisco state and for mayor of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. While the PAN landslide in Jalisco may broaden faith in electoral results, cleaner elections are likely to have little effect on the large gap between the rich and poor and the lack of a significant middle class. In the hills of Chiapas, too, people are reacting to government intervention the way they traditionally have -- with fear. Villages have been abandoned by peasants who may not belong to the Zapatista rebels, but who don't want to be mistaken for one.	What is the significance of the Robledo resignation?	1

The government made another effort to appease critics on Tuesday when the PRI governor of Chiapas, Eduardo Robledo, resigned in hopes of ending a bitter election dispute and helping to pacify a state roiled by rebellion. 'I view the Robledo resignation as a sign of reassurance that political solutions are available and that hard-liners have not taken over the government,' said Delal Baer, a Mexico specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Zedillo took office in December promising a final cleanup of Mexico's long-notorious elections. But almost immediately, some regional PRI dinosaurs took advantage of Zedillo's promise to stay out of state affairs by using riots to block a federal solution of an election dispute that they feared could cost them control of Tabasco state.

Challenged by hard-liners in his own party and blocked in efforts to negotiate peace in Chiapas, Zedillo was accused of weakness.

	How has the sardine fishing been going?	1
LOS ANGELES - The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. 'Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,' Hanson said. 'Not very well'. To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast.	What is the cause of the sardine crash?	1

To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast.

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs from an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, portions of which are torn and decayed. By analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty. The name of Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner, who identified the tomb's occupant with the help of graduate student Kevin Cahail. Some other names on the list are obliterated. 'They basically were forgotten to history,' Wegner said. 'In the later king lists, they don't appear. They just kind of vanish'. The tomb, dated to 1650 B.C., appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said.	What was the name of the unknown pharaoh?	1

	What measures have been taken to conserve water in Willits?	1
LOS ANGELES - Officials of the small town of Willits, Calif., looked at their two municipal reservoirs last week, did some calculating and realized they had enough water to last only 100 days. It was time to adopt the toughest rationing measures they could. The 5,000 residents of this former lumber town in Mendocino County on the edge of redwood country are now on a crash water diet. A family of four isn't supposed to use more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent. 'The more we looked at the data, the more we realized the situation is bleak,' Willits City Manager Adrienne Moore said. As the winter progresses with no break from last year's parched conditions, concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977.

The snow and rain could still come. Only about half the rainy season is over. But if monotonously sunny weather continues to curse the state, the pain of water shortages will spread, albeit unevenly. 'A lot of the smaller systems are going to be really hurting because they really don't have a lot of carry-over' of supplies from one year to the next, said Maury Roos, the state's chief hydrologist. Water managers in Southern California, on the other hand, say they have enough reserves to get the state's most populous region through the year and even into 2015 without rationing. San Francisco's water stores are also in decent shape. The huge Imperial Irrigation District in Imperial County - one of the nation's major sources of winter lettuce and vegetables - will get its regular Colorado River deliveries this year. And growers with the most senior water rights on the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers won't suffer more than a 25 percent cut in irrigation deliveries.

PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble.

PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. 'Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against. We need to make it sexier and more relevant in a highly competitive market,' said Paul B. Redman, director of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., and a strong supporter of a four-year remedial campaign outlined in the letter. That campaign calls for: A scientific study of the problem to support with numbers what backers believe to be true. An education plan outlining how horticulture can be integrated into K-through-12 curriculums and promoted on college campuses.	What is the goal of the four-year remedial campaign?	1

LOS ANGELES - A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study. Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio. The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a pollen-borne RNA virus that spread systematically through the bees and hives.

Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes, according to the study. Commercially cultivated bees pollinate about 90 crops worldwide, a service valued at $14 billion annually. But those colonies have been collapsing, and scientists have attributed that devastation to a deadly cocktail of pathogens, as well as pesticides and beekeeping practices that stress the insect's immune system. In California, the $3 billion almond industry spends $239 million annually to rent more than 1 million beehives, and that cost is escalating. Only about 5 percent of plant viruses are known to be transmitted by pollen, and fewer still have been known to jump from the plant kingdom to insects. That adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse disorder, scientists warned.	What are the implications of this virus jumping from plants to bees?	1

The tobacco ringspot virus acts as a 'quasi-species,' replicating in a way that creates ample mutations that subvert the host's immune response. That phenomenon is believed to be the driving factor of recurring viral infections of avian and swine influenza and of the persistence of HIV, the study noted. 'They have a high mutation rate,' said Yan Ping Chen, a bee pathologist at the USDA Agricultural Research Service laboratory in Maryland and lead author of the study. 'Because of their genetic diversity, we see a lot of host jumping'. The virus' relative role in the demise of colonies has not been measured - it would be difficult to separate it from a cocktail of pathogens and stresses negatively affecting bees, Chen said. 'I want to be cautious,' Chen said. 'The cause of colony collapse disorder remains unclear.	What is the correlation between the virus and the weak colonies?	1

Rio's beaches, overwhelmed with holiday visitors, have been inundated with trash, much of it floating in water just yards (meters) from the sand. That's where authorities hope the eco-boats will make an impact. They're rectangular crafts made of steel and fitted with powerful speedboat motors and a sieve that traps garbage floating up to 18 inches (45 centimeters) below the water's surface, capturing everything from household trash to bigger items like abandoned television sets and refrigerators. The trash is dumped into the boat, where recyclables are sorted out. The vessels don't address sewage, but authorities insist they'll make a big dent in the overall pollution. 'Our objective is to not to have floating garbage in Guanabara Bay,' said Gelson Serva, who heads the state government's latest bay cleanup program, an $840 million project that includes efforts to expand the capacity of the city's strained sewage treatment system. Only 30 percent of Rio's sewage is treated, with the rest flowing into area rivers, the bay, local lagoons and its world-famous beaches. 'Those who live around the bay can already notice a difference over the past two years,' Serva said as the clanking sieve dumped garbage into the ship's hull.

'It's heartbreaking that it's come to this, but it's the right thing to do,' Paul Gibbons, managing director of the nonprofit Turtle Conservancy's Behler Chelonian Center in Ventura County, said as he gently placed a 30-pound adult female ploughshare tortoise on a small table. With a steady hand and an electric engraving tool, he carved an identification code on the high, rounded shell as the creature with weary eyes and gleaming carapace peered calmly into the distance. The tortoise was branded for life, which in her case would be roughly 160 years. 'We've blemished her natural beauty, so she's just a number in a system now,' Gibbons said. 7001 MG'.

In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down. The State Education Commission and the Chinese Society for Science and Technology issued an urgent circular this week banning such schools after receiving complaints that the elite schools imposed heavy financial burdens on the families of such children, official reports said Wednesday. The move reflects a national crisis in China's educational system, which is struggling for survival following a withdrawal of most state funding. Despite China's unparalleled affluence in recent years, the number of illiterates has soared -- now accounting for one in five people aged 15 or older, Vice Premier Li Ruihuan said in a recent policy speech. So have drop out rates in the countryside, where many families are unable to afford fees charged for even the most basic schooling.

Willoughby is expected to help outline battlefield positions and trace the course of battle to find out where men might have fallen or been buried. Eight teams will spread throughout Vietnam to interview witnesses and excavate at old battlefields, burial sites and areas where U.S. helicopters and airplanes crashed. The planned five-week operation will be the 34th in a series that started in September 1988, Garrett said.	If only 55 were in imminent danger of being captured, what happened to the rest of them?	1
Joint teams of American and Vietnamese specialists plan Thursday to start investigating the fate of 85 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. A survivor of the bloody 1968 battle at Lang Vei Special Forces camps in central Quang Tri province will help dig for the remains of five of his missing comrades, said Air Force Major Randall Garrett, operations officer for the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi. Frank C. Willoughby, a retired major in the Army's Special Forces -- known as the Green Berets, will return to Lang Vei, where North Vietnamese tanks and infantry overran a base of camps on Feb. 7, 1968, during the Tet Offensive. His participation is unusual, but not unheard of.

The U.S. Defense Department lists 1,621 Americans as missing in Vietnam, but only 55 of them were last seen alive and in imminent danger of being captured. Most were killed in action or lost over the ocean, but their bodies were never recovered, defense officials say. Another 505 U.S. servicemen are unaccounted for in Laos, 77 in Cambodia and eight in China.

	What is the American Hollywood Film Orchestra?	1
BEIJING - Two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's equivalent of the Met, performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were having a vaudevillian moment. It was the latest stop on a blitzkrieg winter tour of China for a somewhat motley but certainly merry group of American minstrels definitely not from Hollywood. They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'.	Is this strategy consistently successful?	1

On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off.	Why was Nolan angry?	1

	Why are sharks hunted?	1
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope. Using a special solar-powered tag, marine scientists now can study a shark's movements for up to two years by way of data beamed to satellites. Previously, researchers relied on tags that ran on batteries and sometimes died before all the information could be transmitted. The new tags are like 'a smartphone for marine animals,' said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices. 'Just like smartphones, the tags have many sensors and communication capability'. The Guy Harvey Research Institute, based in Dania Beach, Fla., is looking to use the solar tags to track certain species of the fierce fish, including tigers, makos, hammerheads, oceanic white tip and sand sharks.

The overall success of solar tags has yet to be proven because of their relatively limited use. But so far marine researchers have encountered no serious problems, and a growing number of agencies plan to purchase them, manufactures said. By drawing on solar energy, the tags ensure power is available to beam to a satellite a range of data, including how deep the fish go and the water temperatures they encounter. That information is then transmitted to researchers.	What happens after 6 months?	1

	What are the statistics on child obesity?	1
From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse.	Do these statistics change when we examine only lower education families?	1
From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead.

In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor. In 2003, 86.6 percent of adolescents living with parents who had college degrees told survey-takers that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes continuously sometime in the last seven days. By 2011, 90.1 percent said they had done so. In contrast, 79.8 percent of adolescent children with parents who did not go beyond high school said in 2003 that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes in the previous week. By 2011, the numbers of those adolescents who had done so had barely budged, at 80.4 percent. Asked whether they had engaged in at least 10 minutes of continuous physical activity in the last 30 days, 94.7 percent of adolescents with college-educated parents said yes. But among teens with parents with high school educations or less, 82.1 percent of teens said they had engaged in even that minimal level of exercise.

And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction. 'This shows that recovery is actually feasible and possible,' says Daniel Gammons, biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.	How did the species manage to come off the endangered species list?	1

'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'.	Did they disperse the bighorns into specific places along the Sierra's crest?	1

Teams of biologists and volunteers in 2000 began their research, and in 2007 started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn by dispersing them into herds along the Sierra's crest. The agencies designated 16 areas for the bighorns with the initial goal of repopulating 12 of them. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March near Lodgepole is the 10th and next on the list are Laurel Creek on the southern end of Sequoia National Park and Taboose Creek on the eastern border of Kings Canyon National Park. The two parks fully enclose or share a border with 10 of the 16 areas covering about 22 percent of all designated critical habitat across the Sierra, Gammons said.

Fisher is representing Riley, the San Diego man whose case will be heard along with a separate flip-phone search challenge filed by a Boston-area native named Brima Wurie. The cases pose potentially far-reaching consequences for police and phone users alike. Privacy advocates fear that a ruling against Riley and Wurie would render vulnerable the secrets of the 90 percent of U.S. adults who own cellphones, a growing number of which are outfitted like the various iPhone, Samsung or Android models. Law enforcement officials, in turn, fear they might lose an invaluable investigative tool. 'A photograph, short video, letter, list of addresses or other material that could be properly seized from an arrestee's pocket in paper form is not imbued with special First and Fourth Amendment protection simply because it is digitized and carried on a cellphone,' the California attorney general's office wrote in a brief. California Solicitor General Edward C. Dumont, whom President Barack Obama once nominated to the federal bench, will join with Obama's Deputy Solicitor General Michael R. Dreeben in urging the court to give law enforcement leeway in searching smartphones. The Riley and Wurie cases present different scenarios, and they'll be argued back to back for an hour each on Tuesday morning. Both rest on the warrant-less searches of devices unimagined at the time the Fourth Amendment was ratified in 1791. 'I think the Riley case, in particular, is incredibly important,' Elizabeth B. Wydra, chief counsel of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, said Friday, 'and it should be important for everyone who has a smartphone'.	How does Riley's defense characterize him?	1

Similar offers in the past have been ignored by the feisty Chechens. The talks Wednesday were to be held in Sleptsovsk with the Russian side represented by Col. Gen. Anatoly Kulikov, commander of Russian troops in Chechnya. Many doubt the cease-fire can hold given the bitterness of the conflict. Emil Pain, an adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, was quoted as saying a 'cooling period after combat operations' is needed before negotiations could take place.

President Clinton has approved a proposal to ease trade and other economic sanctions against Serbia in a new effort to end the war in Bosnia, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. In return, President Slobodan Milosevic would have to recognize Bosnia as a sovereign country, a blow to his hopes for a Greater Serbia, and agree to other conditions designed to end the 34-month ethnic conflict. The aim is to drive a wedge between Milosevic and the Serbs in Bosnia who have rejected past peace proposals by isolating them from their patrons and arms suppliers in Belgrade. The main lure for Milosevic would be at least temporary renewal of trade and fuel supplies. The sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security Council, have devastated Serbia's economy.

	What is the implication of the government's decision to close down special schools for gifted students in China?	1
In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down. The State Education Commission and the Chinese Society for Science and Technology issued an urgent circular this week banning such schools after receiving complaints that the elite schools imposed heavy financial burdens on the families of such children, official reports said Wednesday. The move reflects a national crisis in China's educational system, which is struggling for survival following a withdrawal of most state funding. Despite China's unparalleled affluence in recent years, the number of illiterates has soared -- now accounting for one in five people aged 15 or older, Vice Premier Li Ruihuan said in a recent policy speech.

So have drop out rates in the countryside, where many families are unable to afford fees charged for even the most basic schooling. 'China's basic education still falls short of the requirements for promoting material and spiritual civilization, and it continues to face many difficulties and problems that demand prompt solution,' Li said. Along with other areas of the economy, the state has relaxed controls on education, allowing some 60,000 non-government run schools to spring up in recent years. Such schools cater to the desire of Chinese parents to improve their childrens' chances of advancing to secondary school and university, at whatever the cost. The elitist nature of such 'Olympic schools,' as they are called, apparently angered Li and other top leaders, who recently began calling for their closure. Although basic education is theoretically supposed to be provided free to all children, many schools, especially the best equipped ones, have begun charging exorbitant fees, official reports say.

'Everyone was fleeing,' she said, holding her 7-month-old son, Cesar. 'I was trying to get together some diapers for my little one, and we were going to the road when we saw the army had already surrounded us.' President Ernesto Zedillo's decision to crack down on the Zapatista National Liberation Army last week was billed as a non-violent effort to arrest Zapatista leaders and restore law and order in Chiapas. But thousands of impoverished peasants who sympathized with rebel demands for Indian rights are taking no chances with the troops this time around. Seven days after the Zapatistas surged out of the jungle to take Morelia and other nearby towns on New Year's Day 1994, the army entered. Villagers alleged that the soldiers arrested three villagers, tortured them and dumped their bodies in the road. The army denied the claims, but an extensive forensic investigation of the mens' remains by the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights corroborated the villagers' claims they had been tortured and murdered. The fear has worked both ways, however.	What were some of the complaints against the Zapatistas from the refugees?	1

Joint teams of American and Vietnamese specialists plan Thursday to start investigating the fate of 85 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. A survivor of the bloody 1968 battle at Lang Vei Special Forces camps in central Quang Tri province will help dig for the remains of five of his missing comrades, said Air Force Major Randall Garrett, operations officer for the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi. Frank C. Willoughby, a retired major in the Army's Special Forces -- known as the Green Berets, will return to Lang Vei, where North Vietnamese tanks and infantry overran a base of camps on Feb. 7, 1968, during the Tet Offensive. His participation is unusual, but not unheard of. The search for remains of the 2,211 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the war rarely requires help from survivors of a specific battle, Garrett said. Willoughby is expected to help outline battlefield positions and trace the course of battle to find out where men might have fallen or been buried. Eight teams will spread throughout Vietnam to interview witnesses and excavate at old battlefields, burial sites and areas where U.S. helicopters and airplanes crashed. The planned five-week operation will be the 34th in a series that started in September 1988, Garrett said.	What happened to the majority of the missing U.S. servicemen from the Vietnam War?	1

MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high.

MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high. Every spring, from Florida to New Jersey, crabs that look more like fossils than a postcard for passion make their way ashore by the thousands when the moon is bright to lay millions of eggs that provide critical food for migrating shorebirds. But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect the continuing decline stems from fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for their sky-blue blood, which is used to screen for toxins in injectable drugs. As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another. The shortage of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food. Now, with the crabs' prime mating season in Florida underway, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is trying enlist help from the public, much in the way it has recruited volunteers to count sea turtles. By reporting on the crabs' night-time trysts, researchers hope to understand not just their habits, but calculate their numbers. 'It's a really cool creature,' said Tiffany Black, a state biologist at the Sen. George Kirkpatrick Marine Lab in Cedar Key. 'It helps people. But it's one of these things that's maligned and overlooked, and the more information the better'.	What have the results of the annual spring survey been so far?	1

So far, people have reported spotting crabs a total of 2,800 times, enough to get an idea about where they may be located, but not enough to tell researchers about populations, Black explained. 'If we can get people working regularly, even if just for a few months of the year, from March, on a full moon … that shows us something,' she said. 'You need multiple years of data from the same place, at the same time, to do any sort of analysis'.	What is unique about the horseshoe crab's existence and its relation to other species?	1

	What was the reaction of Palestinians to Professor Mohammed Dajani's visit to Auschwitz with his students?	1
	How did the idea of taking students to Auschwitz come about for Professor Dajani?	1
JERUSALEM - Professor Mohammed Dajani expected criticism when he took Palestinian students to Poland last month to visit the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. But he wasn't prepared for the uproar that followed. In online posts and comments, Palestinian critics denounced the visit as treason. Acquaintances counseled the professor to keep a low profile, stay away from his university campus and consider taking a vacation abroad, he recalled. 'People said we were giving support to Zionism and promoting its propaganda, as if we were giving up on our rights,' Dajani said in an interview in East Jerusalem, the city's Arab side, which Palestinians claim as the capital of a future state. He is no stranger to controversy. The director of the American studies program at Al Quds University, Dajani heads an organization called Wasatia, whose declared aim is to promote a culture of moderation and reconciliation among Palestinians - values that often seem in short supply in the festering conflict with Israel. Dajani said the idea of taking students to Auschwitz took shape after he made a journey to the site three years ago on a visit sponsored by The Aladdin Project, a Paris-based organization that promotes understanding between Muslims and Jews. 'In my community you see a lot of ignorance of the Holocaust, denial of the Holocaust. People don't want to recognize the suffering of the other,' Dajani said. 'I felt that I did not want to be a bystander, and wanted to bring more awareness and consciousness among Palestinians of this issue'. Because of its crucial role in the creation of Israel, the Holocaust is freighted with political overtones in Palestinian society, where many think that their people have paid the price for the persecution of the Jews in Europe. Palestinians consider their mass displacement and expulsion in the war that followed the establishment of Israel a 'catastrophe' of similar magnitude, and they recall it in annual commemorations just as Jews will mark Holocaust Remembrance Day this year beginning at sundown Sunday. 'The Holocaust is not taught in Palestinian schools and universities,' Dajani said.	What action has Professor Mohammed Dajani taken to address the lack of Holocaust education among Palestinians?	1

BEIJING - Two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's equivalent of the Met, performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were having a vaudevillian moment. It was the latest stop on a blitzkrieg winter tour of China for a somewhat motley but certainly merry group of American minstrels definitely not from Hollywood. They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'. To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them.

BEIJING - Two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's equivalent of the Met, performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were having a vaudevillian moment.

To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them. On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off. Nearby, percussionist Chris Nolan briefly had steam coming out of his ears. 'Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!' he exclaimed, pointing at the pitted and sagging drum heads. Stagehands with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and the local promoter buzzed around the stage, trying to figure out what to do. But as they say in Hollywood, the show must go on, and so it did. (Nolan got his new drum heads 20 minutes before the curtain went up for the show, called 'Classic Oscar: The American Hollywood Film Orchestra New Year's Audio-Visual Concert'.) At 7:30 p.m., conductor Jason Altieri took to the podium, raised his baton and launched the group into Berlioz's 'Rakoczi March'. Its ostensible Oscar connection? Well, there was none, but the song was included in the 1966 French film 'La Grande Vadrouille,' which, judging from the accompanying clips on a giant screen at the rear of the stage, was a slapstick comedy with lots of Nazis. The orchestra's grueling schedule - 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, 11 p.m. dinners, with travel, rehearsal and performances in between - attests to the popularity of Hollywood fare in China as well as the seemingly insatiable demand for Western orchestral music as the country invests heavily in new concert venues and classical music education. In just the last few months, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Diego Symphony, the BBC Concert Orchestra, Canada's National Arts Center Orchestra and even Pierce College's L.A. Symphonic Winds have staged China tours. Also known as the Hollywood Concert Orchestra and the Hollywood Festival Orchestra, the movie-themed ensemble has been making the rounds in China for the last several years.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope. Using a special solar-powered tag, marine scientists now can study a shark's movements for up to two years by way of data beamed to satellites. Previously, researchers relied on tags that ran on batteries and sometimes died before all the information could be transmitted. The new tags are like 'a smartphone for marine animals,' said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices. 'Just like smartphones, the tags have many sensors and communication capability'. The Guy Harvey Research Institute, based in Dania Beach, Fla., is looking to use the solar tags to track certain species of the fierce fish, including tigers, makos, hammerheads, oceanic white tip and sand sharks.

Sharks are critical to the overall balance of ocean ecosystems, but commercial fishermen catch them by the millions for their fins, cartilage and meat. 'We've learned a lot from tagging sharks, not least of which is that they are highly migratory,' said Antonio Fins, executive director of the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation, which supports the institute. 'They are not American sharks or Bahamian sharks or Mexican sharks. They don't know borders or nationalities'. About 40 research agencies already use solar tags, which were put on the market two years ago. For instance, the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Sciences studies a variety of sharks, while others use them to track turtles and marine mammals that spend time in the sun. The overall success of solar tags has yet to be proven because of their relatively limited use. But so far marine researchers have encountered no serious problems, and a growing number of agencies plan to purchase them, manufactures said. By drawing on solar energy, the tags ensure power is available to beam to a satellite a range of data, including how deep the fish go and the water temperatures they encounter. That information is then transmitted to researchers.	What happens to the solar-powered tags after they have collected data for about six months?	1

ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products. Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies.

Among the watchers was Armando Ortega, a city official who back in 1983 got a tip from a landfill employee about the massive dump of games. 'It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games,' he said. They braved the darkness, coyotes and snakes of the desert landfill and had to sneak past the security guard. But it paid off. He says they found dozens of crushed cartridges that they took home and were still playable in their game consoles. The game and its contribution to the demise of Atari have been the source of fascination for video game enthusiasts for 30 years. The search for the cartridges will be featured in an upcoming documentary about the biggest video game company of the early '80s. Xbox Entertainment Studios is one of the companies developing the film, which is expected to be released later this year on Microsoft's Xbox game consoles.

FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction.

FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park.

'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'.	What was the initial plan for repopulating the Sierra Nevada bighorns?	1

WASHINGTON - The Founding Fathers will meet the selfie generation next week when the Supreme Court dials up the case of a California man incriminated by his smartphone. Loaded with pictures, some of them imprudent, David Leon Riley's Samsung Instinct was searched by police in 2009 without a warrant. He got busted. Now the justices, who sometimes seem uncomfortable with new technologies, will consider a quintessentially 21st-century problem. In an unplugged courtroom Tuesday, where television cameras and electronic devices have long been banned, justices must fit data-packed smartphones into the contours of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. The eventual outcome will clarify rules that were written long before phones wised up. 'A modern smartphone,' Stanford Law School professor Jeffrey L. Fisher noted in a brief, 'is a portal into our most sensitive and confidential affairs. The digital contents of such a device should not be subject to a fishing expedition'. Fisher is representing Riley, the San Diego man whose case will be heard along with a separate flip-phone search challenge filed by a Boston-area native named Brima Wurie.	What are the potential implications for law enforcement if the ruling is against Riley and Wurie?	1

She referred to a Feb. 1 meeting in Brussels, Belgium of the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization which handed out catch limits of Greenland halibut off Canada's coast. During the meeting, Canada called a vote to apportion the dwindling halibut stocks which left EU boats a drastically reduced share -- 12.6 percent -- of the catch. EU delegates boycotted the vote, and Bonino said Tuesday EU fishermen would ignore the allotment and fish the region as before. 'The EU fishermen will not interrupt their fishing,' she told the Parliament. Dividing the catch among NAFO members 'sets a dangerous precedent for the future,' she added. She also said the halibut stock is not in danger. Bonino said she would ask the EU's executive branch and fisheries ministers of the 15 EU nations to decide quickly whether to start an objection procedure in NAFO against Canada and the vote results. NAFO members agreed last September to a 1995 catch limit of 27,000 tons of Greenland halibut in NAFO-managed international waters outside Canada's 200-mile zone.

Police arrested a suspected Serb war criminal Tuesday for investigation of charges including accessory to genocide, but a judge later released the man. A judge with the country's highest criminal court questioned the suspect and refused late Tuesday to issue a formal arrest warrant for the man, saying there was not enough evidence for such a move, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said. The man, whose name was withheld, remains under investigation. The suspect was 'not a big fish' and not one of the 21 Serbs accused by an international tribunal in The Hague on Monday, said Ralf Hannich, spokesman for the prosecutor. Those charges set the stage for the first war crimes trial since World War II.

The presses were already rolling when the German publisher decided last week to scrap publication of 'An Eye for an Eye: The Untold Story of Jewish Revenge Against Germans in 1945.' The book by American journalist John Sack, published in the United States in 1993, was deemed inappropriate for German readers: a chronicle of Jewish concentration camp survivors taking murderous revenge on Germans in postwar internment camps. Although Sack's facts were not disputed, Germany's cultural elite decided the book was not a serious work and, worse, could be exploited by right-wing extremists to try to diminish the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews. German intellectuals do not dispute that some Jews committed atrocities against innocent Germans immediately after the war, but find it understandable considering the evil the Nazis unleashed. In a country where skinhead hate-mongers periodically firebomb refugee homes, many feel they have a special responsibility to shield the public from anything that could fuel a neo-Nazi resurgence.

'This is the greatest filth,' Ralph Giordano, a German Jewish writer, said of Sack's book. He has not read it, but nevertheless had no trouble calling it 'vulgar artistic fetish.' Citing the German Federal Archives, Sack says 60,000 to 80,000 ethnic Germans died from 1945 to 1948 at internment camps Stalin set up through the Polish Communist government's Office of State Security. Many were beaten and tortured to death, or died of typhus or other diseases. Sack said at least 20 percent of the total number of inmates died at the 1,255 camps, largely in the Silesia region now in Poland. Stalin deliberately put Jews in charge of many of the camps. The powerful German critic Eike Geisel slammed Sack's book as sadistic sensationalism in a seething polemic that called the work a 'vile docudrama' and a gift to neo-Nazis. Geisel's Jan. 26 review of the book, under the headline 'Anti-Semitic Fodder,' provoked a barrage of complaints to publisher R. Piper of Munich.

The British and Irish governments said they achieved a breakthrough Tuesday on efforts to reach a shared vision of a Northern Ireland political settlement. After 5 1/2 hours of negotiations at Stormont Castle east of Belfast, Britain's senior official in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said they had largely resolved the issues that had slowed down a key part of peacemaking efforts. They declined to discuss specifics of their new areas of agreement before publication of the finished product -- the long-awaited 'framework document' outlining the British-ruled province's future. All factions in Northern Ireland, divided broadly into pro-British Protestant and Irish Catholic camps, are waiting to see which side the document will favor. Spring suggested that may happen next week, 'if everything goes extraordinarily well.' He said he and Mayhew would most likely meet again later this week for 'dotting the i's and crossing the t's,' then present the document to their governments for approval. Mayhew was more cautious, saying at a separate press conference: 'Some important obstacles have been overcome. The outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that have to be done.' Tuesday's session was the first formal meeting between the two governments since September, the month the Irish Republican Army began observing an open-ended truce. That cease-fire has largely held and -- jointly with a truce by pro-British 'loyalist' groups called in mid-October -- has given Northern Ireland its first extended period of calm since 1969, when British troops were deployed in response to Protestant-Catholic street violence. But efforts to agree on the so-called 'framework document,' spelling out how Britain and the Irish Republic view the likely terms of compromise, had run into trouble.

President Ernesto Zedillo seems to be pushing Mexico toward greater democracy and freer elections while wielding a club to help him keep his political balance. But how this will improve the lives of most Mexicans remains to be seen. On Thursday, the president ended a yearlong truce with the leftist Indian rebels in southern Chiapas state, sending thousands of troops to occupy former rebel villages. Federal police fanned out across the state and country to arrest suspected rebels and question sympathizers. The nation's most famed leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, told tens of thousands of protesters in Mexico City on Saturday that Zedillo had started 'a prolonged war that will last many years, causing many deaths.' Yet a day after the angry protest, members of the conservative opposition National Action Party were dancing in the streets of Guadalajara to celebrate what party leaders called a 'victory for democracy.' Zedillo's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, peacefully accepted the worst defeat in its 66-year history in the race for governor of Jalisco state and for mayor of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. While the PAN landslide in Jalisco may broaden faith in electoral results, cleaner elections are likely to have little effect on the large gap between the rich and poor and the lack of a significant middle class. In the hills of Chiapas, too, people are reacting to government intervention the way they traditionally have -- with fear. Villages have been abandoned by peasants who may not belong to the Zapatista rebels, but who don't want to be mistaken for one.	What is the significance of the resignation of the PRI governor of Chiapas, Eduardo Robledo?	1

But almost immediately, some regional PRI dinosaurs took advantage of Zedillo's promise to stay out of state affairs by using riots to block a federal solution of an election dispute that they feared could cost them control of Tabasco state. Challenged by hard-liners in his own party and blocked in efforts to negotiate peace in Chiapas, Zedillo was accused of weakness. He quickly took a club to the Zapatistas, thrilling hard-liners who had been frustrated by a year of inconclusive negotiations with the lightly armed rebels. 'He's got a real contradiction,' Baer said.	What is the challenge President Zedillo faces in his approach to governance?	1

To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. The reason for the drop is unclear.

Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72 percent since its last peak in 2006.	What is the stance of conservation groups on the current sardine harvesting practices?	1

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs from an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, portions of which are torn and decayed. By analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty. The name of Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner, who identified the tomb's occupant with the help of graduate student Kevin Cahail. Some other names on the list are obliterated. 'They basically were forgotten to history,' Wegner said. 'In the later king lists, they don't appear. They just kind of vanish'. The tomb, dated to 1650 B.C., appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said. Even the king's bodily remains were ripped apart. Preliminary work on the skeleton, conducted by Penn graduate students Paul Verhelst and Matthew Olson, suggests that Senebkay stood about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and died in his mid- to late 40s.

	What measures were taken in response to the water shortage in Willits, California?	1
LOS ANGELES - Officials of the small town of Willits, Calif., looked at their two municipal reservoirs last week, did some calculating and realized they had enough water to last only 100 days. It was time to adopt the toughest rationing measures they could. The 5,000 residents of this former lumber town in Mendocino County on the edge of redwood country are now on a crash water diet. A family of four isn't supposed to use more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent. 'The more we looked at the data, the more we realized the situation is bleak,' Willits City Manager Adrienne Moore said.

	What was the outcome of the federal appeals court's decision on excluding prospective jurors based on their sexual orientation?	1
	What implications does this ruling have on laws that discriminate against gays, including those related to same-sex marriage?	1
SAN FRANCISCO - A federal appeals court became the first in the nation to rule that prospective jurors may not be excluded because of their sexual orientation, a decision that expands juror protections beyond race and gender and provides legal ammunition to challenge laws that limit gay rights. The sweeping, unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a mixed jury verdict in an antitrust case involving an AIDS drug. The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury. California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said.

California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said. The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays differently from others, including bans on same-sex marriage, lawyers said. A challenge to Nevada's marriage law is already pending in the 9th Circuit, and gays are fighting marriage bans in trial courts in Oregon, Idaho and Arizona. When a law discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it must be closely evaluated to 'ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status,' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court. The panel said excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Gay rights activists applauded the ruling and predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage was reinstated last summer. 'This is really a very big deal,' said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. 'It is likely to have a significant impact on other cases'. David Codell, constitutional litigation director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the decision would make it 'exceedingly difficult' for states to justify discriminating against gays in all sorts of contexts.

The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury. California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said. The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays differently from others, including bans on same-sex marriage, lawyers said. A challenge to Nevada's marriage law is already pending in the 9th Circuit, and gays are fighting marriage bans in trial courts in Oregon, Idaho and Arizona. When a law discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it must be closely evaluated to 'ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status,' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court. The panel said excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Gay rights activists applauded the ruling and predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage was reinstated last summer. 'This is really a very big deal,' said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. 'It is likely to have a significant impact on other cases'. David Codell, constitutional litigation director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the decision would make it 'exceedingly difficult' for states to justify discriminating against gays in all sorts of contexts. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham Corp., now GlaxoSmithKline, against Abbott Laboratories. The case involved a decision by Abbott to raise the price of an AIDS drug, a move that infuriated the gay community.	What was SmithKline's response to the removal of the juror?	1
PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science.

LOS ANGELES - A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study. Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio. The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a pollen-borne RNA virus that spread systematically through the bees and hives. Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes, according to the study. Commercially cultivated bees pollinate about 90 crops worldwide, a service valued at $14 billion annually. But those colonies have been collapsing, and scientists have attributed that devastation to a deadly cocktail of pathogens, as well as pesticides and beekeeping practices that stress the insect's immune system. In California, the $3 billion almond industry spends $239 million annually to rent more than 1 million beehives, and that cost is escalating. Only about 5 percent of plant viruses are known to be transmitted by pollen, and fewer still have been known to jump from the plant kingdom to insects. That adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse disorder, scientists warned.	What characteristic of the tobacco ringspot virus makes it particularly harmful to honeybees?	1

	What is not included in the U.S. exports of nuclear material?	2
U.S. exports of nuclear material cannot be adequately traced from country to country, according to a congressional report. 'Scarcely a day goes by without a report of a new black market deal,' said Sen. John Glenn in a statement reacting to the report. 'Given the staggering amount of nuclear materials we have exported, it could only be a matter of time before some of this deadly contraband proves to be of U.S. origin.' As chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs in the last Congress, Glenn commissioned the report from the General Accounting Office, which conducts investigations for legislators. The report says hundreds of tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium have accumulated worldwide, mostly from nuclear power generation. It does not include figures on U.S. nuclear exports but says 71 export licenses for nuclear materials were granted in 1993. Nuclear exports for weapons use or weapons research are prohibited, as is transfer of nuclear materials to a third country.	How much plutonium is needed to make a nuclear weapon?	2

FRESNO, Calif. - California water authorities are killing salmon and destroying farming. They're endangering shorebirds, threatening city taps and quite possibly raising the crime rate. That's a sampling of the four dozen comments and protests on the website of the State Water Resources Control Board about emergency water management after the driest winter in decades. From all over California, farmers, environmental lawyers, wildlife groups, cities and even the Fresno County sheriff have posted thoughts in a siege of protests to state officials about the use of this year's puny snowpack and half-empty reservoirs. 'This year is a whole new level of crazy,' said Ara Azhderian of the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority, representing many farmers who are forecast to get zero water this year. Besides fear, exactly what is setting everybody off? Mostly, it's about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta - a perennial California argument filled with suspicion, lawsuits and politics. San Joaquin Valley farm groups say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean for nature, robbing the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry. Environmental and fishery groups say agriculture is manipulating the drought crisis to extract delta water, exposing even non-threatened fish and the fishing industry to catastrophic losses. The argument spilled into the spotlight in February and March, oddly because storms finally began hitting the state after a sunny, disappointingly dry December and January. The February and March storms caused river flow through the delta to spike.	What did farmers do to get extra flow?	2

It was the latest stop on a blitzkrieg winter tour of China for a somewhat motley but certainly merry group of American minstrels definitely not from Hollywood. They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'. To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them. On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope. Using a special solar-powered tag, marine scientists now can study a shark's movements for up to two years by way of data beamed to satellites. Previously, researchers relied on tags that ran on batteries and sometimes died before all the information could be transmitted. The new tags are like 'a smartphone for marine animals,' said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices. 'Just like smartphones, the tags have many sensors and communication capability'. The Guy Harvey Research Institute, based in Dania Beach, Fla., is looking to use the solar tags to track certain species of the fierce fish, including tigers, makos, hammerheads, oceanic white tip and sand sharks.

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise.	What about families with less than high-school educations?	2
From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.	How many of these adolescents reported having done at least 10 minutes of physical activity in the last week?	2
ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products. Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage.

By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies. Among the watchers was Armando Ortega, a city official who back in 1983 got a tip from a landfill employee about the massive dump of games. 'It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games,' he said. They braved the darkness, coyotes and snakes of the desert landfill and had to sneak past the security guard. But it paid off. He says they found dozens of crushed cartridges that they took home and were still playable in their game consoles.	Why did they decide to do it?	2
FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction. 'This shows that recovery is actually feasible and possible,' says Daniel Gammons, biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. 'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'. Teams of biologists and volunteers in 2000 began their research, and in 2007 started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn by dispersing them into herds along the Sierra's crest. The agencies designated 16 areas for the bighorns with the initial goal of repopulating 12 of them. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March near Lodgepole is the 10th and next on the list are Laurel Creek on the southern end of Sequoia National Park and Taboose Creek on the eastern border of Kings Canyon National Park. The two parks fully enclose or share a border with 10 of the 16 areas covering about 22 percent of all designated critical habitat across the Sierra, Gammons said. Recovery efforts date back to the 1970s when the bighorn population declined to one area - Wheeler Ridge on the northern edge of Kings Canyon.	How much is the cost of rearing of the animals now?	2

The European Union's fisheries chief said Tuesday she will ask EU nations to consider fighting Canada over stocks of Greenland halibut. 'The (EU executive) Commission has no intention of passively accepting the NAFO decision,' said Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino, speaking to members of the European Parliament. She referred to a Feb. 1 meeting in Brussels, Belgium of the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization which handed out catch limits of Greenland halibut off Canada's coast. During the meeting, Canada called a vote to apportion the dwindling halibut stocks which left EU boats a drastically reduced share -- 12.6 percent -- of the catch. EU delegates boycotted the vote, and Bonino said Tuesday EU fishermen would ignore the allotment and fish the region as before.	What does she say about this precedent?	2

LOS ANGELES - The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. 'Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,' Hanson said. 'Not very well'. To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. The reason for the drop is unclear.

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs from an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, portions of which are torn and decayed. By analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty. The name of Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner, who identified the tomb's occupant with the help of graduate student Kevin Cahail. Some other names on the list are obliterated. 'They basically were forgotten to history,' Wegner said. 'In the later king lists, they don't appear. They just kind of vanish'. The tomb, dated to 1650 B.C., appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said. Even the king's bodily remains were ripped apart. Preliminary work on the skeleton, conducted by Penn graduate students Paul Verhelst and Matthew Olson, suggests that Senebkay stood about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and died in his mid- to late 40s. The tomb contained remains of a funerary mask, a coffin, and a cedar chest that would have been used to house the king's internal organs, customarily removed before burial. The chest apparently had been reused from the nearby tomb of an earlier king who already was known to history. The discovery of that tomb, belonging to a king named Sobekhotep, was announced by the Penn-Egypt team this week. The rash of discoveries began last year, when Wegner and colleagues found a 60-ton stone sarcophagus chamber that appeared to have been moved from its original site. They identified its original owner as Sobekhotep, but are still identifying the king for whom it was reused.	What about the tombs of other apparent rulers?	2

LOS ANGELES - Officials of the small town of Willits, Calif., looked at their two municipal reservoirs last week, did some calculating and realized they had enough water to last only 100 days. It was time to adopt the toughest rationing measures they could. The 5,000 residents of this former lumber town in Mendocino County on the edge of redwood country are now on a crash water diet. A family of four isn't supposed to use more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent. 'The more we looked at the data, the more we realized the situation is bleak,' Willits City Manager Adrienne Moore said.	What crops will be grown this year if the drought does not abate?	2
PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. 'Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against. We need to make it sexier and more relevant in a highly competitive market,' said Paul B. Redman, director of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., and a strong supporter of a four-year remedial campaign outlined in the letter. That campaign calls for: A scientific study of the problem to support with numbers what backers believe to be true. An education plan outlining how horticulture can be integrated into K-through-12 curriculums and promoted on college campuses. An advocacy and marketing strategy to raise public awareness of horticulture's importance and of career options. 'We have to come up with a game plan. Period,' said Redman, who has been in horticulture for three decades and who still has to define for people what that means.	What is the answer to the question?	2

LOS ANGELES - The booming illegal international wildlife trade forced conservationists to do the unthinkable Tuesday: Brand the golden domes of two of the rarest tortoises on Earth to reduce their black market value by making it easier for authorities to trace them if stolen. 'It's heartbreaking that it's come to this, but it's the right thing to do,' Paul Gibbons, managing director of the nonprofit Turtle Conservancy's Behler Chelonian Center in Ventura County, said as he gently placed a 30-pound adult female ploughshare tortoise on a small table. With a steady hand and an electric engraving tool, he carved an identification code on the high, rounded shell as the creature with weary eyes and gleaming carapace peered calmly into the distance. The tortoise was branded for life, which in her case would be roughly 160 years. 'We've blemished her natural beauty, so she's just a number in a system now,' Gibbons said. 7001 MG'. The 2-inch- by-1 1/2-inch block figures were placed at the top of the turtle's back, a location chosen to avoid interfering with the expansion of the shell, which grows at the edges. The Conservancy's goal is to mark every one of the estimated 360 ploughshares in captive breeding programs around the world and the 300 believed to be remaining in the wild. So far, no rare tortoise or turtle with identification markings has turned up in illegal markets monitored by law enforcement authorities, conservationists said. Decades of intense collecting, hunting and habitat destruction have brought that species and dozens of others to the brink of extinction. Now, sanctuaries and zoos are using visible identification marks - shell notches, clipped toenails, paint, laser inscribing, tattoos and engraving - as a tool to fight poaching and dissuade wealthy collectors willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for critically endangered turtles and tortoises. The shells of two confiscated ploughshare tortoises were engraved at the Singapore Zoo in December. In October, the Turtle Conservancy helped mark the shells of 150 Burmese star tortoises in Myanmar.

	What would be the main incentive for Milosevic to agree to the proposed easing of economic sanctions?	2
President Clinton has approved a proposal to ease trade and other economic sanctions against Serbia in a new effort to end the war in Bosnia, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. In return, President Slobodan Milosevic would have to recognize Bosnia as a sovereign country, a blow to his hopes for a Greater Serbia, and agree to other conditions designed to end the 34-month ethnic conflict. The aim is to drive a wedge between Milosevic and the Serbs in Bosnia who have rejected past peace proposals by isolating them from their patrons and arms suppliers in Belgrade. The main lure for Milosevic would be at least temporary renewal of trade and fuel supplies. The sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security Council, have devastated Serbia's economy.

President Clinton has approved a proposal to ease trade and other economic sanctions against Serbia in a new effort to end the war in Bosnia, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday.

The aim is to drive a wedge between Milosevic and the Serbs in Bosnia who have rejected past peace proposals by isolating them from their patrons and arms suppliers in Belgrade. The main lure for Milosevic would be at least temporary renewal of trade and fuel supplies. The sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security Council, have devastated Serbia's economy. Under the proposal cleared by Clinton and the governments of Britain, France, Germany and Russia, economic sanctions would be lifted -- or later reimposed -- depending on Milosevic's actions. Milosevic would be required to recognize three other former Yugoslav republics, Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia, thereby acknowledging the breakup of what once was Yugoslavia, and permit stricter policing of his border with Bosnia. At the United Nations, a spokesman said Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 'would welcome mutual recognition between the successor states of the former Yugoslavia and, in those circumstances, the lifting of the sanctions imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.' The spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said Boutros-Ghali favors 'any development which will make it possible for the Security Council to maintain' U.N. protection forces in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Weapons are still getting through to the Serbs in Bosnia despite a pledge by Milosevic to cut them off, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under the proposed deal, Milosevic would have to agree to the posting of more monitors on Serbia's border with Bosnia to check on his compliance with a pledge to stop arming Serbs in Bosnia. The official stressed the sanctions would be lifted only temporarily and would be reimposed if the Serbian leader reneged. Unaffected by the plan, he said, would be Serbia's 'illegitimacy' status on the world stage -- its exclusion from the World Bank and other international groups.

	When will the ban on elite schools go into effect?	2
In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down. The State Education Commission and the Chinese Society for Science and Technology issued an urgent circular this week banning such schools after receiving complaints that the elite schools imposed heavy financial burdens on the families of such children, official reports said Wednesday. The move reflects a national crisis in China's educational system, which is struggling for survival following a withdrawal of most state funding. Despite China's unparalleled affluence in recent years, the number of illiterates has soared -- now accounting for one in five people aged 15 or older, Vice Premier Li Ruihuan said in a recent policy speech. So have drop out rates in the countryside, where many families are unable to afford fees charged for even the most basic schooling. 'China's basic education still falls short of the requirements for promoting material and spiritual civilization, and it continues to face many difficulties and problems that demand prompt solution,' Li said. Along with other areas of the economy, the state has relaxed controls on education, allowing some 60,000 non-government run schools to spring up in recent years. Such schools cater to the desire of Chinese parents to improve their childrens' chances of advancing to secondary school and university, at whatever the cost. The elitist nature of such 'Olympic schools,' as they are called, apparently angered Li and other top leaders, who recently began calling for their closure. Although basic education is theoretically supposed to be provided free to all children, many schools, especially the best equipped ones, have begun charging exorbitant fees, official reports say.

Joint teams of American and Vietnamese specialists plan Thursday to start investigating the fate of 85 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. A survivor of the bloody 1968 battle at Lang Vei Special Forces camps in central Quang Tri province will help dig for the remains of five of his missing comrades, said Air Force Major Randall Garrett, operations officer for the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi. Frank C. Willoughby, a retired major in the Army's Special Forces -- known as the Green Berets, will return to Lang Vei, where North Vietnamese tanks and infantry overran a base of camps on Feb. 7, 1968, during the Tet Offensive. His participation is unusual, but not unheard of. The search for remains of the 2,211 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the war rarely requires help from survivors of a specific battle, Garrett said. Willoughby is expected to help outline battlefield positions and trace the course of battle to find out where men might have fallen or been buried. Eight teams will spread throughout Vietnam to interview witnesses and excavate at old battlefields, burial sites and areas where U.S. helicopters and airplanes crashed.

To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them. On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off. Nearby, percussionist Chris Nolan briefly had steam coming out of his ears. 'Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!' he exclaimed, pointing at the pitted and sagging drum heads. Stagehands with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and the local promoter buzzed around the stage, trying to figure out what to do. But as they say in Hollywood, the show must go on, and so it did. (Nolan got his new drum heads 20 minutes before the curtain went up for the show, called 'Classic Oscar: The American Hollywood Film Orchestra New Year's Audio-Visual Concert'.) At 7:30 p.m., conductor Jason Altieri took to the podium, raised his baton and launched the group into Berlioz's 'Rakoczi March'. Its ostensible Oscar connection? Well, there was none, but the song was included in the 1966 French film 'La Grande Vadrouille,' which, judging from the accompanying clips on a giant screen at the rear of the stage, was a slapstick comedy with lots of Nazis. The orchestra's grueling schedule - 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, 11 p.m. dinners, with travel, rehearsal and performances in between - attests to the popularity of Hollywood fare in China as well as the seemingly insatiable demand for Western orchestral music as the country invests heavily in new concert venues and classical music education. In just the last few months, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Diego Symphony, the BBC Concert Orchestra, Canada's National Arts Center Orchestra and even Pierce College's L.A. Symphonic Winds have staged China tours.	Who is the lone Californian in the 2013-14 lineup of the Hollywood Film Orchestra?	2
	How are researchers studying the movements of sharks?	2
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope. Using a special solar-powered tag, marine scientists now can study a shark's movements for up to two years by way of data beamed to satellites. Previously, researchers relied on tags that ran on batteries and sometimes died before all the information could be transmitted. The new tags are like 'a smartphone for marine animals,' said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices. 'Just like smartphones, the tags have many sensors and communication capability'. The Guy Harvey Research Institute, based in Dania Beach, Fla., is looking to use the solar tags to track certain species of the fierce fish, including tigers, makos, hammerheads, oceanic white tip and sand sharks. The goal is to better understand their migratory patterns and ultimately keep their population healthy.

	What is the limitation of the hopeful signs regarding child obesity rates stabilizing and possibly reversing?	2
From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent.	How could the class gap in obesity rates affect efforts to combat obesity-related diseases in the future?	2

At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.

But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.

In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor. In 2003, 86.6 percent of adolescents living with parents who had college degrees told survey-takers that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes continuously sometime in the last seven days. By 2011, 90.1 percent said they had done so. In contrast, 79.8 percent of adolescent children with parents who did not go beyond high school said in 2003 that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes in the previous week. By 2011, the numbers of those adolescents who had done so had barely budged, at 80.4 percent. Asked whether they had engaged in at least 10 minutes of continuous physical activity in the last 30 days, 94.7 percent of adolescents with college-educated parents said yes. But among teens with parents with high school educations or less, 82.1 percent of teens said they had engaged in even that minimal level of exercise.

FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction.

FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction. 'This shows that recovery is actually feasible and possible,' says Daniel Gammons, biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. 'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'. Teams of biologists and volunteers in 2000 began their research, and in 2007 started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn by dispersing them into herds along the Sierra's crest. The agencies designated 16 areas for the bighorns with the initial goal of repopulating 12 of them. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March near Lodgepole is the 10th and next on the list are Laurel Creek on the southern end of Sequoia National Park and Taboose Creek on the eastern border of Kings Canyon National Park. The two parks fully enclose or share a border with 10 of the 16 areas covering about 22 percent of all designated critical habitat across the Sierra, Gammons said.	What were the recovery efforts in the 1970s and 1980s that helped reintroduce Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep to other areas?	2

The eventual outcome will clarify rules that were written long before phones wised up. 'A modern smartphone,' Stanford Law School professor Jeffrey L. Fisher noted in a brief, 'is a portal into our most sensitive and confidential affairs. The digital contents of such a device should not be subject to a fishing expedition'.

Police arrested a suspected Serb war criminal Tuesday for investigation of charges including accessory to genocide, but a judge later released the man. A judge with the country's highest criminal court questioned the suspect and refused late Tuesday to issue a formal arrest warrant for the man, saying there was not enough evidence for such a move, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said. The man, whose name was withheld, remains under investigation. The suspect was 'not a big fish' and not one of the 21 Serbs accused by an international tribunal in The Hague on Monday, said Ralf Hannich, spokesman for the prosecutor.

After 5 1/2 hours of negotiations at Stormont Castle east of Belfast, Britain's senior official in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said they had largely resolved the issues that had slowed down a key part of peacemaking efforts. They declined to discuss specifics of their new areas of agreement before publication of the finished product -- the long-awaited 'framework document' outlining the British-ruled province's future. All factions in Northern Ireland, divided broadly into pro-British Protestant and Irish Catholic camps, are waiting to see which side the document will favor. Spring suggested that may happen next week, 'if everything goes extraordinarily well.' He said he and Mayhew would most likely meet again later this week for 'dotting the i's and crossing the t's,' then present the document to their governments for approval. Mayhew was more cautious, saying at a separate press conference: 'Some important obstacles have been overcome. The outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that have to be done.' Tuesday's session was the first formal meeting between the two governments since September, the month the Irish Republican Army began observing an open-ended truce. That cease-fire has largely held and -- jointly with a truce by pro-British 'loyalist' groups called in mid-October -- has given Northern Ireland its first extended period of calm since 1969, when British troops were deployed in response to Protestant-Catholic street violence. But efforts to agree on the so-called 'framework document,' spelling out how Britain and the Irish Republic view the likely terms of compromise, had run into trouble.

As envisioned, the body would set policy on tourism, transport and relations with the 15-nation European Union on behalf of separate parliaments in Dublin and Belfast, treating the independent south and British-ruled north as one unit.

That brings the total of Palestinians held by Israel to nearly 6,000. He called on Arafat to ban the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups in autonomous Gaza Strip and Jericho. The fundamentalist groups, which oppose the Israel-PLO peace process, claimed bombing attacks that have killed 56 Israelis since October.

LOS ANGELES - The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. 'Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,' Hanson said. 'Not very well'. To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food.

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs from an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, portions of which are torn and decayed. By analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty. The name of Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner, who identified the tomb's occupant with the help of graduate student Kevin Cahail. Some other names on the list are obliterated.	What happened to the rulers of the Abydos dynasty according to later king lists?	2

LOS ANGELES - Officials of the small town of Willits, Calif., looked at their two municipal reservoirs last week, did some calculating and realized they had enough water to last only 100 days. It was time to adopt the toughest rationing measures they could. The 5,000 residents of this former lumber town in Mendocino County on the edge of redwood country are now on a crash water diet. A family of four isn't supposed to use more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent. 'The more we looked at the data, the more we realized the situation is bleak,' Willits City Manager Adrienne Moore said. As the winter progresses with no break from last year's parched conditions, concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977. The snow and rain could still come. Only about half the rainy season is over. But if monotonously sunny weather continues to curse the state, the pain of water shortages will spread, albeit unevenly.

PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. 'Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against. We need to make it sexier and more relevant in a highly competitive market,' said Paul B. Redman, director of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., and a strong supporter of a four-year remedial campaign outlined in the letter. That campaign calls for: A scientific study of the problem to support with numbers what backers believe to be true. An education plan outlining how horticulture can be integrated into K-through-12 curriculums and promoted on college campuses. An advocacy and marketing strategy to raise public awareness of horticulture's importance and of career options. 'We have to come up with a game plan. Period,' said Redman, who has been in horticulture for three decades and who still has to define for people what that means. Which may be the first hurdle this initiative faces - besides funding, which is still an unknown. And it's laughably elementary: What is horticulture, anyway? By the book, horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, and ornamental plants. More often, in the public mind, 'it's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower, a low-paying job requiring manual labor and no college degree,' said Mary H. Meyer, horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota and, as president of the American Society for Horticultural Science, a critical force in the campaign. Meyer cites other career opportunities: plant breeding; greenhouse and food production; the cut-flower, landscape, and nursery industries; public gardens, parks, and sports turf; research into global climate change, plant pests, and diseases, water quality, biofuels, and food safety and security; and the psychological and physiological benefits of plants.	What concerns did the Royal Horticultural Society express in a report in May?	2
PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science.

LOS ANGELES - A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study. Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio. The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a pollen-borne RNA virus that spread systematically through the bees and hives. Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes, according to the study.

Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes, according to the study. Commercially cultivated bees pollinate about 90 crops worldwide, a service valued at $14 billion annually. But those colonies have been collapsing, and scientists have attributed that devastation to a deadly cocktail of pathogens, as well as pesticides and beekeeping practices that stress the insect's immune system. In California, the $3 billion almond industry spends $239 million annually to rent more than 1 million beehives, and that cost is escalating. Only about 5 percent of plant viruses are known to be transmitted by pollen, and fewer still have been known to jump from the plant kingdom to insects. That adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse disorder, scientists warned. The tobacco ringspot virus acts as a 'quasi-species,' replicating in a way that creates ample mutations that subvert the host's immune response. That phenomenon is believed to be the driving factor of recurring viral infections of avian and swine influenza and of the persistence of HIV, the study noted. 'They have a high mutation rate,' said Yan Ping Chen, a bee pathologist at the USDA Agricultural Research Service laboratory in Maryland and lead author of the study. 'Because of their genetic diversity, we see a lot of host jumping'.	What evidence do we have regarding the role of the tobacco ringspot virus in the collapse of honeybee colonies?	2

Wooden doors hang ajar. Flies buzz on a mound of drying corn dough. A skinny dog whines at a gate. Nearly 1,200 people who supported Indian rebels lived here, but the loudest sound now is the breeze rustling through the banana trees. More than 300 army troops, accompanied by two helicopters, rolled through this village Friday as part of its crackdown on the rebel movement in the southern state of Chiapas. Roughly 800 adults and 350 children fled into the jungle as they arrived. 'They left food on the table, lights on,' Abraham Castaneda of the National Nutrition Institute said Tuesday. 'Children were separated from their parents in their terror.' 'We heard the noise of the trucks, many of them,' said 23-year-old Maria Hernandez, one of perhaps 50 residents who remain here. 'Everyone was fleeing,' she said, holding her 7-month-old son, Cesar. 'I was trying to get together some diapers for my little one, and we were going to the road when we saw the army had already surrounded us.' President Ernesto Zedillo's decision to crack down on the Zapatista National Liberation Army last week was billed as a non-violent effort to arrest Zapatista leaders and restore law and order in Chiapas. But thousands of impoverished peasants who sympathized with rebel demands for Indian rights are taking no chances with the troops this time around. Seven days after the Zapatistas surged out of the jungle to take Morelia and other nearby towns on New Year's Day 1994, the army entered. Villagers alleged that the soldiers arrested three villagers, tortured them and dumped their bodies in the road. The army denied the claims, but an extensive forensic investigation of the mens' remains by the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights corroborated the villagers' claims they had been tortured and murdered.

Joint teams of American and Vietnamese specialists plan Thursday to start investigating the fate of 85 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. A survivor of the bloody 1968 battle at Lang Vei Special Forces camps in central Quang Tri province will help dig for the remains of five of his missing comrades, said Air Force Major Randall Garrett, operations officer for the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi. Frank C. Willoughby, a retired major in the Army's Special Forces -- known as the Green Berets, will return to Lang Vei, where North Vietnamese tanks and infantry overran a base of camps on Feb. 7, 1968, during the Tet Offensive. His participation is unusual, but not unheard of. The search for remains of the 2,211 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the war rarely requires help from survivors of a specific battle, Garrett said. Willoughby is expected to help outline battlefield positions and trace the course of battle to find out where men might have fallen or been buried. Eight teams will spread throughout Vietnam to interview witnesses and excavate at old battlefields, burial sites and areas where U.S. helicopters and airplanes crashed. The planned five-week operation will be the 34th in a series that started in September 1988, Garrett said. The U.S. Defense Department lists 1,621 Americans as missing in Vietnam, but only 55 of them were last seen alive and in imminent danger of being captured. Most were killed in action or lost over the ocean, but their bodies were never recovered, defense officials say.	What are the two countries that the U.S. has opened liaison offices in?	2
MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach.	What has caused the decline of horseshoe crabs in recent years?	2
MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high. Every spring, from Florida to New Jersey, crabs that look more like fossils than a postcard for passion make their way ashore by the thousands when the moon is bright to lay millions of eggs that provide critical food for migrating shorebirds. But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect the continuing decline stems from fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for their sky-blue blood, which is used to screen for toxins in injectable drugs. As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another. The shortage of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food. Now, with the crabs' prime mating season in Florida underway, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is trying enlist help from the public, much in the way it has recruited volunteers to count sea turtles. By reporting on the crabs' night-time trysts, researchers hope to understand not just their habits, but calculate their numbers. 'It's a really cool creature,' said Tiffany Black, a state biologist at the Sen. George Kirkpatrick Marine Lab in Cedar Key.	How many horseshoe crabs are caught each year?	2

FRESNO, Calif. - California water authorities are killing salmon and destroying farming. They're endangering shorebirds, threatening city taps and quite possibly raising the crime rate. That's a sampling of the four dozen comments and protests on the website of the State Water Resources Control Board about emergency water management after the driest winter in decades. From all over California, farmers, environmental lawyers, wildlife groups, cities and even the Fresno County sheriff have posted thoughts in a siege of protests to state officials about the use of this year's puny snowpack and half-empty reservoirs.

JERUSALEM - Professor Mohammed Dajani expected criticism when he took Palestinian students to Poland last month to visit the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. But he wasn't prepared for the uproar that followed. In online posts and comments, Palestinian critics denounced the visit as treason. Acquaintances counseled the professor to keep a low profile, stay away from his university campus and consider taking a vacation abroad, he recalled. 'People said we were giving support to Zionism and promoting its propaganda, as if we were giving up on our rights,' Dajani said in an interview in East Jerusalem, the city's Arab side, which Palestinians claim as the capital of a future state. He is no stranger to controversy. The director of the American studies program at Al Quds University, Dajani heads an organization called Wasatia, whose declared aim is to promote a culture of moderation and reconciliation among Palestinians - values that often seem in short supply in the festering conflict with Israel. Dajani said the idea of taking students to Auschwitz took shape after he made a journey to the site three years ago on a visit sponsored by The Aladdin Project, a Paris-based organization that promotes understanding between Muslims and Jews. 'In my community you see a lot of ignorance of the Holocaust, denial of the Holocaust. People don't want to recognize the suffering of the other,' Dajani said. 'I felt that I did not want to be a bystander, and wanted to bring more awareness and consciousness among Palestinians of this issue'. Because of its crucial role in the creation of Israel, the Holocaust is freighted with political overtones in Palestinian society, where many think that their people have paid the price for the persecution of the Jews in Europe. Palestinians consider their mass displacement and expulsion in the war that followed the establishment of Israel a 'catastrophe' of similar magnitude, and they recall it in annual commemorations just as Jews will mark Holocaust Remembrance Day this year beginning at sundown Sunday. 'The Holocaust is not taught in Palestinian schools and universities,' Dajani said. 'It is a history ignored, mentioned as part of a plot to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, or as Zionist propaganda with exaggerated figures'. Dajani has advocated publicly for Holocaust education among Palestinians and has devoted part of his own classes to the subject. The trip to Auschwitz was arranged as part of a reconciliation research project sponsored by the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany, which also included a visit by Israeli students to Deheishe, a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank.

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor. In 2003, 86.6 percent of adolescents living with parents who had college degrees told survey-takers that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes continuously sometime in the last seven days. By 2011, 90.1 percent said they had done so. In contrast, 79.8 percent of adolescent children with parents who did not go beyond high school said in 2003 that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes in the previous week. By 2011, the numbers of those adolescents who had done so had barely budged, at 80.4 percent. Asked whether they had engaged in at least 10 minutes of continuous physical activity in the last 30 days, 94.7 percent of adolescents with college-educated parents said yes. But among teens with parents with high school educations or less, 82.1 percent of teens said they had engaged in even that minimal level of exercise.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products. Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies. Among the watchers was Armando Ortega, a city official who back in 1983 got a tip from a landfill employee about the massive dump of games. 'It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games,' he said.	What was the contribution of 'E.T.' to the demise of Atari?	2
	What was the main cause of the decline of the Sierra Nevada bighorns?	2
FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction. 'This shows that recovery is actually feasible and possible,' says Daniel Gammons, biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. 'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act.	What areas were designated for the bighorns?	2

In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'. Teams of biologists and volunteers in 2000 began their research, and in 2007 started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn by dispersing them into herds along the Sierra's crest. The agencies designated 16 areas for the bighorns with the initial goal of repopulating 12 of them.	When did the bighorn population decline to one area?	2

The 44-year-old man is suspected of belonging to a group of Serbian gunmen which reportedly plundered and set fire to Muslim houses near the Bosnian village of Hadzici. Muslim men who resisted were reportedly shot, while women and children were forced to leave. He is also accused of beating a Muslim woman and robbing another, Hannich said.

The presses were already rolling when the German publisher decided last week to scrap publication of 'An Eye for an Eye: The Untold Story of Jewish Revenge Against Germans in 1945.' The book by American journalist John Sack, published in the United States in 1993, was deemed inappropriate for German readers: a chronicle of Jewish concentration camp survivors taking murderous revenge on Germans in postwar internment camps. Although Sack's facts were not disputed, Germany's cultural elite decided the book was not a serious work and, worse, could be exploited by right-wing extremists to try to diminish the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews.

President Ernesto Zedillo seems to be pushing Mexico toward greater democracy and freer elections while wielding a club to help him keep his political balance. But how this will improve the lives of most Mexicans remains to be seen. On Thursday, the president ended a yearlong truce with the leftist Indian rebels in southern Chiapas state, sending thousands of troops to occupy former rebel villages. Federal police fanned out across the state and country to arrest suspected rebels and question sympathizers. The nation's most famed leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, told tens of thousands of protesters in Mexico City on Saturday that Zedillo had started 'a prolonged war that will last many years, causing many deaths.' Yet a day after the angry protest, members of the conservative opposition National Action Party were dancing in the streets of Guadalajara to celebrate what party leaders called a 'victory for democracy.' Zedillo's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, peacefully accepted the worst defeat in its 66-year history in the race for governor of Jalisco state and for mayor of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. While the PAN landslide in Jalisco may broaden faith in electoral results, cleaner elections are likely to have little effect on the large gap between the rich and poor and the lack of a significant middle class.

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs from an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, portions of which are torn and decayed. By analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty. The name of Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner, who identified the tomb's occupant with the help of graduate student Kevin Cahail.

SAN FRANCISCO - A federal appeals court became the first in the nation to rule that prospective jurors may not be excluded because of their sexual orientation, a decision that expands juror protections beyond race and gender and provides legal ammunition to challenge laws that limit gay rights. The sweeping, unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a mixed jury verdict in an antitrust case involving an AIDS drug. The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury. California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said.

LOS ANGELES - The booming illegal international wildlife trade forced conservationists to do the unthinkable Tuesday: Brand the golden domes of two of the rarest tortoises on Earth to reduce their black market value by making it easier for authorities to trace them if stolen. 'It's heartbreaking that it's come to this, but it's the right thing to do,' Paul Gibbons, managing director of the nonprofit Turtle Conservancy's Behler Chelonian Center in Ventura County, said as he gently placed a 30-pound adult female ploughshare tortoise on a small table. With a steady hand and an electric engraving tool, he carved an identification code on the high, rounded shell as the creature with weary eyes and gleaming carapace peered calmly into the distance. The tortoise was branded for life, which in her case would be roughly 160 years. 'We've blemished her natural beauty, so she's just a number in a system now,' Gibbons said.

In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down. The State Education Commission and the Chinese Society for Science and Technology issued an urgent circular this week banning such schools after receiving complaints that the elite schools imposed heavy financial burdens on the families of such children, official reports said Wednesday. The move reflects a national crisis in China's educational system, which is struggling for survival following a withdrawal of most state funding. Despite China's unparalleled affluence in recent years, the number of illiterates has soared -- now accounting for one in five people aged 15 or older, Vice Premier Li Ruihuan said in a recent policy speech. So have drop out rates in the countryside, where many families are unable to afford fees charged for even the most basic schooling. 'China's basic education still falls short of the requirements for promoting material and spiritual civilization, and it continues to face many difficulties and problems that demand prompt solution,' Li said. Along with other areas of the economy, the state has relaxed controls on education, allowing some 60,000 non-government run schools to spring up in recent years. Such schools cater to the desire of Chinese parents to improve their childrens' chances of advancing to secondary school and university, at whatever the cost. The elitist nature of such 'Olympic schools,' as they are called, apparently angered Li and other top leaders, who recently began calling for their closure. Although basic education is theoretically supposed to be provided free to all children, many schools, especially the best equipped ones, have begun charging exorbitant fees, official reports say.

A survivor of the bloody 1968 battle at Lang Vei Special Forces camps in central Quang Tri province will help dig for the remains of five of his missing comrades, said Air Force Major Randall Garrett, operations officer for the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi.

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark.	is the problem related to information distribution?	2

Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.

FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction. 'This shows that recovery is actually feasible and possible,' says Daniel Gammons, biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. 'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'. Teams of biologists and volunteers in 2000 began their research, and in 2007 started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn by dispersing them into herds along the Sierra's crest.

WASHINGTON - The Founding Fathers will meet the selfie generation next week when the Supreme Court dials up the case of a California man incriminated by his smartphone. Loaded with pictures, some of them imprudent, David Leon Riley's Samsung Instinct was searched by police in 2009 without a warrant. He got busted. Now the justices, who sometimes seem uncomfortable with new technologies, will consider a quintessentially 21st-century problem. In an unplugged courtroom Tuesday, where television cameras and electronic devices have long been banned, justices must fit data-packed smartphones into the contours of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Amid skepticism that Russia's war in Chechnya can be ended across a negotiating table, peace talks were set to resume Wednesday in neighboring Ingushetia. The scheduled resumption of talks in the town of Sleptsovsk came two days after agreement on a limited cease-fire, calling for both sides to stop using heavy artillery Tuesday. They also agreed in principle to work out a mechanism for exchanging prisoners of war and the dead. Despite the pact, artillery fire sounded in the Grozny on Tuesday, and there were reports of Chechen missile attacks southwest of the Chechen capital.

Anatoly Kulikov, commander of Russian troops in Chechnya. Many doubt the cease-fire can hold given the bitterness of the conflict.

President Clinton has approved a proposal to ease trade and other economic sanctions against Serbia in a new effort to end the war in Bosnia, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. In return, President Slobodan Milosevic would have to recognize Bosnia as a sovereign country, a blow to his hopes for a Greater Serbia, and agree to other conditions designed to end the 34-month ethnic conflict.

In return, President Slobodan Milosevic would have to recognize Bosnia as a sovereign country, a blow to his hopes for a Greater Serbia, and agree to other conditions designed to end the 34-month ethnic conflict. The aim is to drive a wedge between Milosevic and the Serbs in Bosnia who have rejected past peace proposals by isolating them from their patrons and arms suppliers in Belgrade. The main lure for Milosevic would be at least temporary renewal of trade and fuel supplies. The sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security Council, have devastated Serbia's economy.

The aim is to drive a wedge between Milosevic and the Serbs in Bosnia who have rejected past peace proposals by isolating them from their patrons and arms suppliers in Belgrade. The main lure for Milosevic would be at least temporary renewal of trade and fuel supplies. The sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security Council, have devastated Serbia's economy. Under the proposal cleared by Clinton and the governments of Britain, France, Germany and Russia, economic sanctions would be lifted -- or later reimposed -- depending on Milosevic's actions. Milosevic would be required to recognize three other former Yugoslav republics, Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia, thereby acknowledging the breakup of what once was Yugoslavia, and permit stricter policing of his border with Bosnia. At the United Nations, a spokesman said Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 'would welcome mutual recognition between the successor states of the former Yugoslavia and, in those circumstances, the lifting of the sanctions imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.' The spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said Boutros-Ghali favors 'any development which will make it possible for the Security Council to maintain' U.N. protection forces in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Weapons are still getting through to the Serbs in Bosnia despite a pledge by Milosevic to cut them off, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under the proposed deal, Milosevic would have to agree to the posting of more monitors on Serbia's border with Bosnia to check on his compliance with a pledge to stop arming Serbs in Bosnia. The official stressed the sanctions would be lifted only temporarily and would be reimposed if the Serbian leader reneged. Unaffected by the plan, he said, would be Serbia's 'illegitimacy' status on the world stage -- its exclusion from the World Bank and other international groups.

In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down.	What was the reaction of top leaders to the elitist nature of the 'Olympic schools'?	2
In a move aimed at shifting the focus of China's schools back to basic education, the government has ordered that all special schools catering to gifted students be closed down. The State Education Commission and the Chinese Society for Science and Technology issued an urgent circular this week banning such schools after receiving complaints that the elite schools imposed heavy financial burdens on the families of such children, official reports said Wednesday. The move reflects a national crisis in China's educational system, which is struggling for survival following a withdrawal of most state funding. Despite China's unparalleled affluence in recent years, the number of illiterates has soared -- now accounting for one in five people aged 15 or older, Vice Premier Li Ruihuan said in a recent policy speech. So have drop out rates in the countryside, where many families are unable to afford fees charged for even the most basic schooling. 'China's basic education still falls short of the requirements for promoting material and spiritual civilization, and it continues to face many difficulties and problems that demand prompt solution,' Li said. Along with other areas of the economy, the state has relaxed controls on education, allowing some 60,000 non-government run schools to spring up in recent years. Such schools cater to the desire of Chinese parents to improve their childrens' chances of advancing to secondary school and university, at whatever the cost. The elitist nature of such 'Olympic schools,' as they are called, apparently angered Li and other top leaders, who recently began calling for their closure. Although basic education is theoretically supposed to be provided free to all children, many schools, especially the best equipped ones, have begun charging exorbitant fees, official reports say.

	What makes a moonlit beach particularly romantic for a horseshoe crab?	2
MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high.	What happened to the population of horseshoe crabs in the 1990s?	2
MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high. Every spring, from Florida to New Jersey, crabs that look more like fossils than a postcard for passion make their way ashore by the thousands when the moon is bright to lay millions of eggs that provide critical food for migrating shorebirds. But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect the continuing decline stems from fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for their sky-blue blood, which is used to screen for toxins in injectable drugs. As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another. The shortage of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food. Now, with the crabs' prime mating season in Florida underway, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is trying enlist help from the public, much in the way it has recruited volunteers to count sea turtles. By reporting on the crabs' night-time trysts, researchers hope to understand not just their habits, but calculate their numbers. 'It's a really cool creature,' said Tiffany Black, a state biologist at the Sen. George Kirkpatrick Marine Lab in Cedar Key. 'It helps people. But it's one of these things that's maligned and overlooked, and the more information the better'. Starting in 2002, the agency has held an annual spring survey, collecting numbers on sightings around the state. So far, people have reported spotting crabs a total of 2,800 times, enough to get an idea about where they may be located, but not enough to tell researchers about populations, Black explained. 'If we can get people working regularly, even if just for a few months of the year, from March, on a full moon … that shows us something,' she said. 'You need multiple years of data from the same place, at the same time, to do any sort of analysis'. The horseshoe crab is not really a crab at all but a relative of the spider. It is one of the oldest unchanged species on Earth known to scientists, older than the continents, and exists only in parts of Asia and North America's Atlantic coast.	What measures were taken to prevent the horseshoe crab from consuming other sea creatures?	2

FRESNO, Calif. - California water authorities are killing salmon and destroying farming. They're endangering shorebirds, threatening city taps and quite possibly raising the crime rate. That's a sampling of the four dozen comments and protests on the website of the State Water Resources Control Board about emergency water management after the driest winter in decades. From all over California, farmers, environmental lawyers, wildlife groups, cities and even the Fresno County sheriff have posted thoughts in a siege of protests to state officials about the use of this year's puny snowpack and half-empty reservoirs. 'This year is a whole new level of crazy,' said Ara Azhderian of the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority, representing many farmers who are forecast to get zero water this year. Besides fear, exactly what is setting everybody off? Mostly, it's about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta - a perennial California argument filled with suspicion, lawsuits and politics. San Joaquin Valley farm groups say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean for nature, robbing the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry.

The director of the American studies program at Al Quds University, Dajani heads an organization called Wasatia, whose declared aim is to promote a culture of moderation and reconciliation among Palestinians - values that often seem in short supply in the festering conflict with Israel. Dajani said the idea of taking students to Auschwitz took shape after he made a journey to the site three years ago on a visit sponsored by The Aladdin Project, a Paris-based organization that promotes understanding between Muslims and Jews. 'In my community you see a lot of ignorance of the Holocaust, denial of the Holocaust. People don't want to recognize the suffering of the other,' Dajani said. 'I felt that I did not want to be a bystander, and wanted to bring more awareness and consciousness among Palestinians of this issue'. Because of its crucial role in the creation of Israel, the Holocaust is freighted with political overtones in Palestinian society, where many think that their people have paid the price for the persecution of the Jews in Europe. Palestinians consider their mass displacement and expulsion in the war that followed the establishment of Israel a 'catastrophe' of similar magnitude, and they recall it in annual commemorations just as Jews will mark Holocaust Remembrance Day this year beginning at sundown Sunday. 'The Holocaust is not taught in Palestinian schools and universities,' Dajani said. 'It is a history ignored, mentioned as part of a plot to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, or as Zionist propaganda with exaggerated figures'. Dajani has advocated publicly for Holocaust education among Palestinians and has devoted part of his own classes to the subject.

On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off. Nearby, percussionist Chris Nolan briefly had steam coming out of his ears. 'Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!' he exclaimed, pointing at the pitted and sagging drum heads. Stagehands with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and the local promoter buzzed around the stage, trying to figure out what to do. But as they say in Hollywood, the show must go on, and so it did. (Nolan got his new drum heads 20 minutes before the curtain went up for the show, called 'Classic Oscar: The American Hollywood Film Orchestra New Year's Audio-Visual Concert'.) At 7:30 p.m., conductor Jason Altieri took to the podium, raised his baton and launched the group into Berlioz's 'Rakoczi March'. Its ostensible Oscar connection? Well, there was none, but the song was included in the 1966 French film 'La Grande Vadrouille,' which, judging from the accompanying clips on a giant screen at the rear of the stage, was a slapstick comedy with lots of Nazis. The orchestra's grueling schedule - 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, 11 p.m. dinners, with travel, rehearsal and performances in between - attests to the popularity of Hollywood fare in China as well as the seemingly insatiable demand for Western orchestral music as the country invests heavily in new concert venues and classical music education. In just the last few months, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Diego Symphony, the BBC Concert Orchestra, Canada's National Arts Center Orchestra and even Pierce College's L.A. Symphonic Winds have staged China tours. Also known as the Hollywood Concert Orchestra and the Hollywood Festival Orchestra, the movie-themed ensemble has been making the rounds in China for the last several years.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope.	What was the limitation of the previous method used by researchers to study a shark's movements?	2
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope. Using a special solar-powered tag, marine scientists now can study a shark's movements for up to two years by way of data beamed to satellites. Previously, researchers relied on tags that ran on batteries and sometimes died before all the information could be transmitted. The new tags are like 'a smartphone for marine animals,' said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices. 'Just like smartphones, the tags have many sensors and communication capability'.	Who is already utilizing the solar tags for research purposes?	2
	Who does the study suggest the hopeful signs of decreasing child obesity rates are limited to?	2
From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent.	What could be the potential impact if the public health message on obesity does not reach all sections of the population evenly?	2

'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products. Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies.

FRESNO, Calif. - Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. That marks a dual milestone - it's the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years while also proving that human intervention can bring the species back from the brink of extinction.	When were the Sierra Nevada bighorns first listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act?	2

'This shows that recovery is actually feasible and possible,' says Daniel Gammons, biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. 'Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success'. It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep.

The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands before settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. 'There was a lot of concern about extinction,' says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. 'But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it's gone as well as anybody could've imagined'. Teams of biologists and volunteers in 2000 began their research, and in 2007 started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn by dispersing them into herds along the Sierra's crest. The agencies designated 16 areas for the bighorns with the initial goal of repopulating 12 of them. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March near Lodgepole is the 10th and next on the list are Laurel Creek on the southern end of Sequoia National Park and Taboose Creek on the eastern border of Kings Canyon National Park. The two parks fully enclose or share a border with 10 of the 16 areas covering about 22 percent of all designated critical habitat across the Sierra, Gammons said.

Police arrested a suspected Serb war criminal Tuesday for investigation of charges including accessory to genocide, but a judge later released the man. A judge with the country's highest criminal court questioned the suspect and refused late Tuesday to issue a formal arrest warrant for the man, saying there was not enough evidence for such a move, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said. The man, whose name was withheld, remains under investigation. The suspect was 'not a big fish' and not one of the 21 Serbs accused by an international tribunal in The Hague on Monday, said Ralf Hannich, spokesman for the prosecutor.

Those charges set the stage for the first war crimes trial since World War II. The 44-year-old man is suspected of belonging to a group of Serbian gunmen which reportedly plundered and set fire to Muslim houses near the Bosnian village of Hadzici. Muslim men who resisted were reportedly shot, while women and children were forced to leave. He is also accused of beating a Muslim woman and robbing another, Hannich said. Only one of the 21 suspects is in custody. Dusan Tadic, a former policeman and karate expert, was detained in Germany last February. Tadic is accused of 13 killings, torture, rape and beatings at the Omarska camp in northern Bosnia. A law allowing the 39-year-old Tadic to be handed over to the Hague tribunal is expected to pass the German parliament in March. Germany is conducting 43 investigations against Serbs -- including Tadic and the man detained Tuesday -- suspected of war crimes in former Yugoslavia, Hannich said.

The presses were already rolling when the German publisher decided last week to scrap publication of 'An Eye for an Eye: The Untold Story of Jewish Revenge Against Germans in 1945.' The book by American journalist John Sack, published in the United States in 1993, was deemed inappropriate for German readers: a chronicle of Jewish concentration camp survivors taking murderous revenge on Germans in postwar internment camps. Although Sack's facts were not disputed, Germany's cultural elite decided the book was not a serious work and, worse, could be exploited by right-wing extremists to try to diminish the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews. German intellectuals do not dispute that some Jews committed atrocities against innocent Germans immediately after the war, but find it understandable considering the evil the Nazis unleashed. In a country where skinhead hate-mongers periodically firebomb refugee homes, many feel they have a special responsibility to shield the public from anything that could fuel a neo-Nazi resurgence. 'This is the greatest filth,' Ralph Giordano, a German Jewish writer, said of Sack's book. He has not read it, but nevertheless had no trouble calling it 'vulgar artistic fetish.' Citing the German Federal Archives, Sack says 60,000 to 80,000 ethnic Germans died from 1945 to 1948 at internment camps Stalin set up through the Polish Communist government's Office of State Security. Many were beaten and tortured to death, or died of typhus or other diseases.	Who was put in charge of many of the internment camps?	2

Olympic champion Mark McKoy, formerly of Canada, now an Austrian citizen, was second, 0:04 seconds behind Johnson. McKoy holds the world record at 50 meters. The previous best indoors for the 110-meter hurdles was 13.58 seconds. England's Colin Jackson holds the outdoor mark for the 110 meters at 12.91. Johnson ran collegiately for North Carolina.

Mayhew was more cautious, saying at a separate press conference: 'Some important obstacles have been overcome. The outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that have to be done.' Tuesday's session was the first formal meeting between the two governments since September, the month the Irish Republican Army began observing an open-ended truce. That cease-fire has largely held and -- jointly with a truce by pro-British 'loyalist' groups called in mid-October -- has given Northern Ireland its first extended period of calm since 1969, when British troops were deployed in response to Protestant-Catholic street violence.

He said he and Mayhew would most likely meet again later this week for 'dotting the i's and crossing the t's,' then present the document to their governments for approval. Mayhew was more cautious, saying at a separate press conference: 'Some important obstacles have been overcome. The outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that have to be done.' Tuesday's session was the first formal meeting between the two governments since September, the month the Irish Republican Army began observing an open-ended truce. That cease-fire has largely held and -- jointly with a truce by pro-British 'loyalist' groups called in mid-October -- has given Northern Ireland its first extended period of calm since 1969, when British troops were deployed in response to Protestant-Catholic street violence. But efforts to agree on the so-called 'framework document,' spelling out how Britain and the Irish Republic view the likely terms of compromise, had run into trouble.

Yasser Arafat must carry out a pledge to reign in anti-Israel violence, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday, calling on the Palestinian leader to outlaw two groups responsible for bombing attacks. Addressing Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Rabin revealed that Israel has in recent months arrested 2,400 Palestinians on suspicion of militant activities. That brings the total of Palestinians held by Israel to nearly 6,000.	Who are the groups responsible for the bombing attacks and what is their stance on the Israel-PLO peace process?	2

President Ernesto Zedillo seems to be pushing Mexico toward greater democracy and freer elections while wielding a club to help him keep his political balance. But how this will improve the lives of most Mexicans remains to be seen. On Thursday, the president ended a yearlong truce with the leftist Indian rebels in southern Chiapas state, sending thousands of troops to occupy former rebel villages. Federal police fanned out across the state and country to arrest suspected rebels and question sympathizers. The nation's most famed leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, told tens of thousands of protesters in Mexico City on Saturday that Zedillo had started 'a prolonged war that will last many years, causing many deaths.'

President Ernesto Zedillo seems to be pushing Mexico toward greater democracy and freer elections while wielding a club to help him keep his political balance.

On Thursday, the president ended a yearlong truce with the leftist Indian rebels in southern Chiapas state, sending thousands of troops to occupy former rebel villages. Federal police fanned out across the state and country to arrest suspected rebels and question sympathizers. The nation's most famed leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, told tens of thousands of protesters in Mexico City on Saturday that Zedillo had started 'a prolonged war that will last many years, causing many deaths.' Yet a day after the angry protest, members of the conservative opposition National Action Party were dancing in the streets of Guadalajara to celebrate what party leaders called a 'victory for democracy.' Zedillo's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, peacefully accepted the worst defeat in its 66-year history in the race for governor of Jalisco state and for mayor of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. While the PAN landslide in Jalisco may broaden faith in electoral results, cleaner elections are likely to have little effect on the large gap between the rich and poor and the lack of a significant middle class. In the hills of Chiapas, too, people are reacting to government intervention the way they traditionally have -- with fear. Villages have been abandoned by peasants who may not belong to the Zapatista rebels, but who don't want to be mistaken for one. The government made another effort to appease critics on Tuesday when the PRI governor of Chiapas, Eduardo Robledo, resigned in hopes of ending a bitter election dispute and helping to pacify a state roiled by rebellion. 'I view the Robledo resignation as a sign of reassurance that political solutions are available and that hard-liners have not taken over the government,' said Delal Baer, a Mexico specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Zedillo took office in December promising a final cleanup of Mexico's long-notorious elections. But almost immediately, some regional PRI dinosaurs took advantage of Zedillo's promise to stay out of state affairs by using riots to block a federal solution of an election dispute that they feared could cost them control of Tabasco state. Challenged by hard-liners in his own party and blocked in efforts to negotiate peace in Chiapas, Zedillo was accused of weakness. He quickly took a club to the Zapatistas, thrilling hard-liners who had been frustrated by a year of inconclusive negotiations with the lightly armed rebels. 'He's got a real contradiction,' Baer said. 'He has to try to appease those dinosaurs and hard-liners in the party that are manageable while keeping the reform path on track.'

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs from an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, portions of which are torn and decayed. By analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty. The name of Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner, who identified the tomb's occupant with the help of graduate student Kevin Cahail. Some other names on the list are obliterated. 'They basically were forgotten to history,' Wegner said. 'In the later king lists, they don't appear. They just kind of vanish'. The tomb, dated to 1650 B.C., appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said.	What information was gathered from the preliminary work on the skeleton found in the tomb?	2

The snow and rain could still come. Only about half the rainy season is over. But if monotonously sunny weather continues to curse the state, the pain of water shortages will spread, albeit unevenly. 'A lot of the smaller systems are going to be really hurting because they really don't have a lot of carry-over' of supplies from one year to the next, said Maury Roos, the state's chief hydrologist.

SAN FRANCISCO - A federal appeals court became the first in the nation to rule that prospective jurors may not be excluded because of their sexual orientation, a decision that expands juror protections beyond race and gender and provides legal ammunition to challenge laws that limit gay rights. The sweeping, unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a mixed jury verdict in an antitrust case involving an AIDS drug. The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury. California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said.

The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury. California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said. The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays differently from others, including bans on same-sex marriage, lawyers said. A challenge to Nevada's marriage law is already pending in the 9th Circuit, and gays are fighting marriage bans in trial courts in Oregon, Idaho and Arizona. When a law discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it must be closely evaluated to 'ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status,' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court. The panel said excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Gay rights activists applauded the ruling and predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage was reinstated last summer. 'This is really a very big deal,' said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. 'It is likely to have a significant impact on other cases'. David Codell, constitutional litigation director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the decision would make it 'exceedingly difficult' for states to justify discriminating against gays in all sorts of contexts. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham Corp., now GlaxoSmithKline, against Abbott Laboratories. The case involved a decision by Abbott to raise the price of an AIDS drug, a move that infuriated the gay community.	What reasons did Abbott provide on appeal for excluding the man from the jury?	2
PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. 'Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against. We need to make it sexier and more relevant in a highly competitive market,' said Paul B. Redman, director of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., and a strong supporter of a four-year remedial campaign outlined in the letter.

That campaign calls for: A scientific study of the problem to support with numbers what backers believe to be true. An education plan outlining how horticulture can be integrated into K-through-12 curriculums and promoted on college campuses. An advocacy and marketing strategy to raise public awareness of horticulture's importance and of career options. 'We have to come up with a game plan. Period,' said Redman, who has been in horticulture for three decades and who still has to define for people what that means. Which may be the first hurdle this initiative faces - besides funding, which is still an unknown. And it's laughably elementary: What is horticulture, anyway? By the book, horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, and ornamental plants. More often, in the public mind, 'it's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower, a low-paying job requiring manual labor and no college degree,' said Mary H. Meyer, horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota and, as president of the American Society for Horticultural Science, a critical force in the campaign. Meyer cites other career opportunities: plant breeding; greenhouse and food production; the cut-flower, landscape, and nursery industries; public gardens, parks, and sports turf; research into global climate change, plant pests, and diseases, water quality, biofuels, and food safety and security; and the psychological and physiological benefits of plants.

LOS ANGELES - A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study. Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio.

Commercially cultivated bees pollinate about 90 crops worldwide, a service valued at $14 billion annually. But those colonies have been collapsing, and scientists have attributed that devastation to a deadly cocktail of pathogens, as well as pesticides and beekeeping practices that stress the insect's immune system. In California, the $3 billion almond industry spends $239 million annually to rent more than 1 million beehives, and that cost is escalating. Only about 5 percent of plant viruses are known to be transmitted by pollen, and fewer still have been known to jump from the plant kingdom to insects. That adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse disorder, scientists warned.

At low tide, mountains of household refuse, old sofas and even washing machines are seen. An Associated Press analysis in November of more than a decade's worth of Rio state government tests on waterways across the city showed fecal coliform pollution levels far above those considered safe by Brazilian or U.S. law. That pollution means nearly all beaches dotting the 148-square-mile (383-square-kilometer) bay have long been abandoned by swimmers, and some health experts warn of risks to athletes who come into contact with the water. Elite sailors have warned that high-speed collisions with floating detritus could damage or even sink sailboats during the Olympics. Water pollution issues began making headlines in Brazil's local press again in recent days, after thick patches of brown foam appeared along the city's most popular beaches like Copacabana as the Southern Hemisphere summer hits full stride. Rio's beaches, overwhelmed with holiday visitors, have been inundated with trash, much of it floating in water just yards (meters) from the sand. That's where authorities hope the eco-boats will make an impact. They're rectangular crafts made of steel and fitted with powerful speedboat motors and a sieve that traps garbage floating up to 18 inches (45 centimeters) below the water's surface, capturing everything from household trash to bigger items like abandoned television sets and refrigerators. The trash is dumped into the boat, where recyclables are sorted out. The vessels don't address sewage, but authorities insist they'll make a big dent in the overall pollution. 'Our objective is to not to have floating garbage in Guanabara Bay,' said Gelson Serva, who heads the state government's latest bay cleanup program, an $840 million project that includes efforts to expand the capacity of the city's strained sewage treatment system. Only 30 percent of Rio's sewage is treated, with the rest flowing into area rivers, the bay, local lagoons and its world-famous beaches. 'Those who live around the bay can already notice a difference over the past two years,' Serva said as the clanking sieve dumped garbage into the ship's hull.

LOS ANGELES - The booming illegal international wildlife trade forced conservationists to do the unthinkable Tuesday: Brand the golden domes of two of the rarest tortoises on Earth to reduce their black market value by making it easier for authorities to trace them if stolen. 'It's heartbreaking that it's come to this, but it's the right thing to do,' Paul Gibbons, managing director of the nonprofit Turtle Conservancy's Behler Chelonian Center in Ventura County, said as he gently placed a 30-pound adult female ploughshare tortoise on a small table. With a steady hand and an electric engraving tool, he carved an identification code on the high, rounded shell as the creature with weary eyes and gleaming carapace peered calmly into the distance. The tortoise was branded for life, which in her case would be roughly 160 years. 'We've blemished her natural beauty, so she's just a number in a system now,' Gibbons said. 7001 MG'. The 2-inch- by-1 1/2-inch block figures were placed at the top of the turtle's back, a location chosen to avoid interfering with the expansion of the shell, which grows at the edges. The Conservancy's goal is to mark every one of the estimated 360 ploughshares in captive breeding programs around the world and the 300 believed to be remaining in the wild. So far, no rare tortoise or turtle with identification markings has turned up in illegal markets monitored by law enforcement authorities, conservationists said. Decades of intense collecting, hunting and habitat destruction have brought that species and dozens of others to the brink of extinction. Now, sanctuaries and zoos are using visible identification marks - shell notches, clipped toenails, paint, laser inscribing, tattoos and engraving - as a tool to fight poaching and dissuade wealthy collectors willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for critically endangered turtles and tortoises. The shells of two confiscated ploughshare tortoises were engraved at the Singapore Zoo in December. In October, the Turtle Conservancy helped mark the shells of 150 Burmese star tortoises in Myanmar.

Amid skepticism that Russia's war in Chechnya can be ended across a negotiating table, peace talks were set to resume Wednesday in neighboring Ingushetia. The scheduled resumption of talks in the town of Sleptsovsk came two days after agreement on a limited cease-fire, calling for both sides to stop using heavy artillery Tuesday. They also agreed in principle to work out a mechanism for exchanging prisoners of war and the dead. Despite the pact, artillery fire sounded in the Grozny on Tuesday, and there were reports of Chechen missile attacks southwest of the Chechen capital. Many Chechens are fighting independently of the forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, and Dudayev's representative at the peace talks, Aslan Maskhadov, has warned that he does not control them.

BEIJING - Two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's equivalent of the Met, performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were having a vaudevillian moment. It was the latest stop on a blitzkrieg winter tour of China for a somewhat motley but certainly merry group of American minstrels definitely not from Hollywood. They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'. To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them. On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off.

BEIJING - Two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's equivalent of the Met, performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were having a vaudevillian moment. It was the latest stop on a blitzkrieg winter tour of China for a somewhat motley but certainly merry group of American minstrels definitely not from Hollywood. They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'. To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them. On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cellists opened the cases to the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off. Nearby, percussionist Chris Nolan briefly had steam coming out of his ears. 'Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!' he exclaimed, pointing at the pitted and sagging drum heads.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope. Using a special solar-powered tag, marine scientists now can study a shark's movements for up to two years by way of data beamed to satellites. Previously, researchers relied on tags that ran on batteries and sometimes died before all the information could be transmitted. The new tags are like 'a smartphone for marine animals,' said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices. 'Just like smartphones, the tags have many sensors and communication capability'. The Guy Harvey Research Institute, based in Dania Beach, Fla., is looking to use the solar tags to track certain species of the fierce fish, including tigers, makos, hammerheads, oceanic white tip and sand sharks. The goal is to better understand their migratory patterns and ultimately keep their population healthy. Sharks are critical to the overall balance of ocean ecosystems, but commercial fishermen catch them by the millions for their fins, cartilage and meat.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products. Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies.

The British and Irish governments said they achieved a breakthrough Tuesday on efforts to reach a shared vision of a Northern Ireland political settlement. After 5 1/2 hours of negotiations at Stormont Castle east of Belfast, Britain's senior official in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said they had largely resolved the issues that had slowed down a key part of peacemaking efforts. They declined to discuss specifics of their new areas of agreement before publication of the finished product -- the long-awaited 'framework document' outlining the British-ruled province's future. All factions in Northern Ireland, divided broadly into pro-British Protestant and Irish Catholic camps, are waiting to see which side the document will favor. Spring suggested that may happen next week, 'if everything goes extraordinarily well.' He said he and Mayhew would most likely meet again later this week for 'dotting the i's and crossing the t's,' then present the document to their governments for approval. Mayhew was more cautious, saying at a separate press conference: 'Some important obstacles have been overcome. The outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that have to be done.' Tuesday's session was the first formal meeting between the two governments since September, the month the Irish Republican Army began observing an open-ended truce. That cease-fire has largely held and -- jointly with a truce by pro-British 'loyalist' groups called in mid-October -- has given Northern Ireland its first extended period of calm since 1969, when British troops were deployed in response to Protestant-Catholic street violence. But efforts to agree on the so-called 'framework document,' spelling out how Britain and the Irish Republic view the likely terms of compromise, had run into trouble.

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.	What about the other kings that were not thought to be of the same dynasty?	3
PHILADELPHIA - Coming from image-conscious professionals who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables, the words were downright shocking: 'Horticulture is under siege'. They jumped off a three-page letter penned by a half-dozen of the country's most prominent plant people sent in December to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions. Clearly, horticulture - once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans - is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. 'Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against. We need to make it sexier and more relevant in a highly competitive market,' said Paul B. Redman, director of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., and a strong supporter of a four-year remedial campaign outlined in the letter. That campaign calls for: A scientific study of the problem to support with numbers what backers believe to be true. An education plan outlining how horticulture can be integrated into K-through-12 curriculums and promoted on college campuses. An advocacy and marketing strategy to raise public awareness of horticulture's importance and of career options. 'We have to come up with a game plan. Period,' said Redman, who has been in horticulture for three decades and who still has to define for people what that means. Which may be the first hurdle this initiative faces - besides funding, which is still an unknown. And it's laughably elementary: What is horticulture, anyway?	What do people think of horticulture according to the book?	3
LOS ANGELES - A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study. Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio. The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a pollen-borne RNA virus that spread systematically through the bees and hives. Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes, according to the study. Commercially cultivated bees pollinate about 90 crops worldwide, a service valued at $14 billion annually. But those colonies have been collapsing, and scientists have attributed that devastation to a deadly cocktail of pathogens, as well as pesticides and beekeeping practices that stress the insect's immune system. In California, the $3 billion almond industry spends $239 million annually to rent more than 1 million beehives, and that cost is escalating. Only about 5 percent of plant viruses are known to be transmitted by pollen, and fewer still have been known to jump from the plant kingdom to insects. That adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse disorder, scientists warned.	How do the resulting mutations affect the virus?	3

RIO DE JANEIRO - A stout green catamaran plied the polluted waters of Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay Monday alongside the local fishing boats, but instead of grouper and swordfish its catch consisted of plastic bags, soda bottles and a discarded toilet seat. The catamaran is one of three so-called 'eco-boats,' floating garbage vessels that are a key part of authorities' pledge to clean up Rio's Guanabara Bay before it and other Rio waterways host events during the 2016 Olympic Games. Critics say the boats do little to address the more pressing question of sewage. With limited trash and sewage services in this sprawling metropolis of 6 million people, tons of garbage and raw waste flow daily from sludge-filled rivers into the bay, where Olympic and Paralympic sailing events will be held. At low tide, mountains of household refuse, old sofas and even washing machines are seen. An Associated Press analysis in November of more than a decade's worth of Rio state government tests on waterways across the city showed fecal coliform pollution levels far above those considered safe by Brazilian or U.S. law. That pollution means nearly all beaches dotting the 148-square-mile (383-square-kilometer) bay have long been abandoned by swimmers, and some health experts warn of risks to athletes who come into contact with the water. Elite sailors have warned that high-speed collisions with floating detritus could damage or even sink sailboats during the Olympics. Water pollution issues began making headlines in Brazil's local press again in recent days, after thick patches of brown foam appeared along the city's most popular beaches like Copacabana as the Southern Hemisphere summer hits full stride. Rio's beaches, overwhelmed with holiday visitors, have been inundated with trash, much of it floating in water just yards (meters) from the sand. That's where authorities hope the eco-boats will make an impact.	What happens after the boat is empty?	3

MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high. Every spring, from Florida to New Jersey, crabs that look more like fossils than a postcard for passion make their way ashore by the thousands when the moon is bright to lay millions of eggs that provide critical food for migrating shorebirds. But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect the continuing decline stems from fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for their sky-blue blood, which is used to screen for toxins in injectable drugs. As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another. The shortage of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food. Now, with the crabs' prime mating season in Florida underway, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is trying enlist help from the public, much in the way it has recruited volunteers to count sea turtles. By reporting on the crabs' night-time trysts, researchers hope to understand not just their habits, but calculate their numbers. 'It's a really cool creature,' said Tiffany Black, a state biologist at the Sen. George Kirkpatrick Marine Lab in Cedar Key. 'It helps people. But it's one of these things that's maligned and overlooked, and the more information the better'. Starting in 2002, the agency has held an annual spring survey, collecting numbers on sightings around the state. So far, people have reported spotting crabs a total of 2,800 times, enough to get an idea about where they may be located, but not enough to tell researchers about populations, Black explained. 'If we can get people working regularly, even if just for a few months of the year, from March, on a full moon … that shows us something,' she said. 'You need multiple years of data from the same place, at the same time, to do any sort of analysis'. The horseshoe crab is not really a crab at all but a relative of the spider. It is one of the oldest unchanged species on Earth known to scientists, older than the continents, and exists only in parts of Asia and North America's Atlantic coast.

FRESNO, Calif. - California water authorities are killing salmon and destroying farming. They're endangering shorebirds, threatening city taps and quite possibly raising the crime rate.

The scheduled resumption of talks in the town of Sleptsovsk came two days after agreement on a limited cease-fire, calling for both sides to stop using heavy artillery Tuesday. They also agreed in principle to work out a mechanism for exchanging prisoners of war and the dead. Despite the pact, artillery fire sounded in the Grozny on Tuesday, and there were reports of Chechen missile attacks southwest of the Chechen capital. Many Chechens are fighting independently of the forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, and Dudayev's representative at the peace talks, Aslan Maskhadov, has warned that he does not control them. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Tuesday that Moscow is also willing to talk to individual field commanders, the Interfax news agency reported.

WASHINGTON - The Founding Fathers will meet the selfie generation next week when the Supreme Court dials up the case of a California man incriminated by his smartphone. Loaded with pictures, some of them imprudent, David Leon Riley's Samsung Instinct was searched by police in 2009 without a warrant. He got busted. Now the justices, who sometimes seem uncomfortable with new technologies, will consider a quintessentially 21st-century problem. In an unplugged courtroom Tuesday, where television cameras and electronic devices have long been banned, justices must fit data-packed smartphones into the contours of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. The eventual outcome will clarify rules that were written long before phones wised up. 'A modern smartphone,' Stanford Law School professor Jeffrey L. Fisher noted in a brief, 'is a portal into our most sensitive and confidential affairs. The digital contents of such a device should not be subject to a fishing expedition'.

LOS ANGELES - The booming illegal international wildlife trade forced conservationists to do the unthinkable Tuesday: Brand the golden domes of two of the rarest tortoises on Earth to reduce their black market value by making it easier for authorities to trace them if stolen. 'It's heartbreaking that it's come to this, but it's the right thing to do,' Paul Gibbons, managing director of the nonprofit Turtle Conservancy's Behler Chelonian Center in Ventura County, said as he gently placed a 30-pound adult female ploughshare tortoise on a small table. With a steady hand and an electric engraving tool, he carved an identification code on the high, rounded shell as the creature with weary eyes and gleaming carapace peered calmly into the distance. The tortoise was branded for life, which in her case would be roughly 160 years. 'We've blemished her natural beauty, so she's just a number in a system now,' Gibbons said. 7001 MG'. The 2-inch- by-1 1/2-inch block figures were placed at the top of the turtle's back, a location chosen to avoid interfering with the expansion of the shell, which grows at the edges. The Conservancy's goal is to mark every one of the estimated 360 ploughshares in captive breeding programs around the world and the 300 believed to be remaining in the wild. So far, no rare tortoise or turtle with identification markings has turned up in illegal markets monitored by law enforcement authorities, conservationists said. Decades of intense collecting, hunting and habitat destruction have brought that species and dozens of others to the brink of extinction. Now, sanctuaries and zoos are using visible identification marks - shell notches, clipped toenails, paint, laser inscribing, tattoos and engraving - as a tool to fight poaching and dissuade wealthy collectors willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for critically endangered turtles and tortoises. The shells of two confiscated ploughshare tortoises were engraved at the Singapore Zoo in December. In October, the Turtle Conservancy helped mark the shells of 150 Burmese star tortoises in Myanmar.

A survivor of the bloody 1968 battle at Lang Vei Special Forces camps in central Quang Tri province will help dig for the remains of five of his missing comrades, said Air Force Major Randall Garrett, operations officer for the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi. Frank C. Willoughby, a retired major in the Army's Special Forces -- known as the Green Berets, will return to Lang Vei, where North Vietnamese tanks and infantry overran a base of camps on Feb. 7, 1968, during the Tet Offensive. His participation is unusual, but not unheard of.	How is Willoughby's help required?	3

MIAMI - In matters of love, nothing says romance like a moonlit beach. Especially if you're a lusty horseshoe crab and the tide is high. Every spring, from Florida to New Jersey, crabs that look more like fossils than a postcard for passion make their way ashore by the thousands when the moon is bright to lay millions of eggs that provide critical food for migrating shorebirds. But in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect the continuing decline stems from fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for their sky-blue blood, which is used to screen for toxins in injectable drugs. As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another.	What is the significance of understanding and preserving the horseshoe crab population?	3
BEIJING - Two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's equivalent of the Met, performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were having a vaudevillian moment. It was the latest stop on a blitzkrieg winter tour of China for a somewhat motley but certainly merry group of American minstrels definitely not from Hollywood. They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as 'Titanic,' 'Dances With Wolves,' 'The Incredibles' and 'The Godfather'. To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them.	What was the reaction to the issues with the loaner instruments and the drum kit?	3

From many corners of the United States - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mississippi - recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children: Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more, child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize, and might reverse. But a study published this week in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents, the hopeful signs are limited to those from better-educated, more affluent families. Among teenagers from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise. Nationally, rates of obesity among adolescents ages 12 to 19 did not rise from 2003 to 2004, and 2009 to 2010. But during those times, obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than high-school educations rose from about 20 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, the obesity rates for teenage children of parents with four-year college degrees or more fell from 14 percent to about 7 percent. 'The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,' the authors of the latest research wrote. That class gap was not evident in younger children - those ages 2 to 10, the researchers said. But as children neared the cusp of adulthood, the class differences became increasingly stark. Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new, and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones. But if the public health message on obesity 'has not diffused evenly across the population,' as the authors of Monday's report suggest, this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a costly obesity-related diseases in the years ahead. In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns, researchers from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor.	Did the percentage of adolescents with parents who did not go beyond high school and who exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes in the previous week increase significantly from 2003 to 2011?	3
ALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A documentary film production company has found buried in a New Mexico landfill hundreds of the Atari 'E.T'. game cartridges that some call the worst video game ever made. Film director Zak Penn showed one 'E.T'. cartridge retrieved from the site and said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico to watch backhoes and bulldozers dig through the concrete-covered landfill in search of up to a million discarded copies of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' that the game's maker wanted to hide forever. 'I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something,' said Penn as members of the production team sifted through the mounds of trash, pulling out boxes, games and other Atari products. Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the 'Back To The Future' movies.

PHILADELPHIA - University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty. The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government. The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology. 'It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty,' said Wegner, an associate curator at Penn's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

SAN FRANCISCO - A federal appeals court became the first in the nation to rule that prospective jurors may not be excluded because of their sexual orientation, a decision that expands juror protections beyond race and gender and provides legal ammunition to challenge laws that limit gay rights. The sweeping, unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a mixed jury verdict in an antitrust case involving an AIDS drug. The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury. California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said. The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays differently from others, including bans on same-sex marriage, lawyers said. A challenge to Nevada's marriage law is already pending in the 9th Circuit, and gays are fighting marriage bans in trial courts in Oregon, Idaho and Arizona. When a law discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it must be closely evaluated to 'ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status,' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court. The panel said excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Gay rights activists applauded the ruling and predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage was reinstated last summer. 'This is really a very big deal,' said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. 'It is likely to have a significant impact on other cases'. David Codell, constitutional litigation director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the decision would make it 'exceedingly difficult' for states to justify discriminating against gays in all sorts of contexts. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham Corp., now GlaxoSmithKline, against Abbott Laboratories. The case involved a decision by Abbott to raise the price of an AIDS drug, a move that infuriated the gay community.
