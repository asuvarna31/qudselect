XT02 The scheduled resumption of talks in the town of Sleptsovsk came two days after agreement on a limited cease-fire, calling for both sides to stop using heavy artillery Tuesday. XT03 They also agreed in principle to work out a mechanism for exchanging prisoners of war and the dead. XT04 Despite the pact, artillery fire sounded in the Grozny on Tuesday, and there were reports of Chechen missile attacks southwest of the Chechen capital. XT05 Many Chechens are fighting independently of the forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, and Dudayev's representative at the peace talks, Aslan Maskhadov, has warned that he does not control them. XT06 Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Tuesday that Moscow is also willing to talk to individual field commanders, the Interfax news agency reported. XT07 Similar offers in the past have been ignored by the feisty Chechens. XT08 The talks Wednesday were to be held in Sleptsovsk with the Russian side represented by Col. Gen. Anatoly Kulikov, commander of Russian troops in Chechnya. XT09 Many doubt the cease-fire can hold given the bitterness of the conflict. XT10 Emil Pain, an adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, was quoted as saying a 'cooling period after combat operations' is needed before negotiations could take place. XT11 Thousands of people have been killed and more than 400,000 displaced since Russian forces stormed into Chechnya on Dec. 11 to crush Dudayev's government and end the region's self-proclaimed independence. XT12 The Russian offensive has turned Grozny into a wasteland littered with rotting bodies, twisted metal and debris. XT13 Hardly a building is untouched. XT14 The war has also cost Russia dearly -- in lives, prestige and rubles. XT15 In Stockholm, both Britain and Sweden pressed Russia's foreign minister Tuesday to explain Moscow's goals in Chechnya. XT16 The questions came during a flurry of meetings between British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and their Swedish hosts. XT17 Chechnya 'is a cloud over reform and our support for reform,' Hurd said before the meeting. XT18 Many experts say the expense of subduing Chechnya could bust the budget and wreck Russia's attempt to refashion its economy along free market lines. XT19 The head of a special commission assigned to supervise Chechnya's reconstruction said Tuesday the cost could be three times the Russian government's estimate.\nAnswer sentence: XT20 Arkady Volsky told Associated Press Television that the political and economic instability the war has caused has driven the overall cost -- including lost foreign and domestic investment -- to dlrs 40 billion.\n\n### Response:", "reference": "Sentence [20] is anchored by sentence [18], answering the question of \"what are the consequences for Russia for the war?\"."}
